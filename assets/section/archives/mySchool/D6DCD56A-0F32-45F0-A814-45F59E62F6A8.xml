    <content>Hi, all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I loaded the first draft of test cases on wikispace under the link "Test Plan". The document is not complete but I need some feedback before I finish it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please feel free to comment, especially on following items:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Are test cases detail enough?&lt;br&gt;2. Is each test case valid ?&lt;br&gt;3. Are there any cases missing?&lt;br&gt;4. Is the language and format used in the document clear and concise?&lt;br&gt;5. Some of the less clear items are underlined on the document. Please feel free to confirm/comment on any of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;S. Suh Lee&lt;br&gt;</content>

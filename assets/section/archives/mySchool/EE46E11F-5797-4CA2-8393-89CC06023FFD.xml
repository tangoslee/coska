    <content>I checked in the initial version of database scripts in the repository. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attached is a MySQL version but has not been tested (simply because I do not have MySQL installed yet). Also this does not include the instructor table discussed at the previous meeting yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Review and give me feedback. If you have a chance to actually test it, let me know the results, and feel free to go ahead and fix the errors if you like. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content>

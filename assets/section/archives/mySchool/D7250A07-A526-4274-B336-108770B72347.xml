            <content>Thank you for all your work. However why don't we share library file(.jar) through CVS too. It may takes some time to download cvs for the first but, that will give us shorter time to run programs. I liked your style that have all library in one folder but after cvs, I think even share library is more efficient to have same dev environment I think...( it is only my opinion if you have a different idea you don't have to...^^)</content>

            <content>I tried to avoid it. it is about 12 MB total. I thought it would be easy enough for you to copy the Hibernate jar files into the jars folder. Will consider though.</content>

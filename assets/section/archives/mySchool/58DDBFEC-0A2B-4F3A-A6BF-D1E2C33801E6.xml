    <content>I added a new test case in StudentTest.java. It shows how to get a student by its ID - i.e. using hSesssion.get(...).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You need to refer to the database script to see which columns must not be null - this should be done as part of validation in the JSP pages - to avoid exceptions coming from the database.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks.&lt;br&gt;</content>

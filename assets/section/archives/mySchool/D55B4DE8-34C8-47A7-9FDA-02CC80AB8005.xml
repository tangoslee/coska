    <content>Even though the meeting agenda is under the jurisdiction of Mr. Kwon, I would like to take the liberty of suggesting the following agenda items :-)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Review and discuss on Chap 3. &amp; Chap 8., also initial discussion on which approach (from Chap. 8) would be appropriate for MySchool (15 minutes)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Data model review (UML &amp; ERD side by side), focused on Entity and its property definitions. In defending their thoughts, arguments and counter-arguments should be strictly based on the written documents - i.e. sample forms and the sample data provided by the customer (this is as opposed to our intangible common sense or perception about the problem domain). Any issues that may arise from possible inaccuracies of the customer samples will be recorded and discussed later with the customer (40 min.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Data model review (UML &amp; ERD side by side), focused on Entity relationship. the same rules apply as the above (20 min.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we cannot make a conclusion in the time limit, the meeting will be continued at a later date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone who is not a project member but is interested in this meeting can email us for read-only participation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please modify the above agenda where necessary.</content>

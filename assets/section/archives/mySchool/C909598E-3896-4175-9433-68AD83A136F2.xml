    <content>JUnit scaffolding has been set up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Create/Search/Delete tests are done against 9 data models among which the User test is the only one that runs without a failure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To run the User test:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Execute install.bat from the command line. This will set up a MySQL database.&lt;br&gt;* Right-click on UserTest.java and select Run As-&amp;gt;JUnit Test. This will run 3 test cases and all of them will be shown as pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To run the entire tests:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Right-click on AllTest.java instead. This will show 24 failures out of 27 runs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Execute uninstall.bat to clean up the database.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that the model API and the database design is not final yet but you should be able to see the picture of what I am doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content>

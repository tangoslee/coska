    <content>Happy New Year!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just joined this project. Following the last direction from Mr. Boo, I am currently looking at Ruby/Watir web testing script tool. It is pretty cool- easy to use, and a lot of default functionality to start with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a few questions though, as I look around the studygroup in the wikispace and discussion board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. I am currently looking at the document called srs.html - Software Requirements Specification and sdd.html - Software Design Document and try to come up with some test cases. It seems like these documents are pretty much complete. Can I start with this one or should I wait until other version? Is there any other document/resource do I need to look at? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Is there source/binaries somewhere that I can load on my machine and start testing? (or rather start getting ready to code Watir scripts)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. It seems like hibernate study is going in parallel with this project. I am wondering how far you guys are. Do you think I can still join the study as well? Which book or material are you guys following for the study?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I appreciate you all for giving me this opportunity, and hope all the best to you and your family in 2006!&lt;br&gt;</content>

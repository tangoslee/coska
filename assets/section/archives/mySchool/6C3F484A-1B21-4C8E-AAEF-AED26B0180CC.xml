    <content>I updated the UML model based on 12/14 customer review:&lt;br&gt;http://studygroup.wikispaces.com/srs.html#toc11&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The software requirements specification (SRS) is planned to be signed off this weekend by the customer. Once this happens (hopefully), starting next week, it will be ISO9001 controlled. Every single change will require approval and be communicated with the customer. Please add/update your contents as much as possible during the weekend.</content>

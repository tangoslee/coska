    <content>I worked on the model tonight and just checked in the code in CVS (COSKA_MySchool_Model).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I plan to write a few sample JUnit test cases hopefully in a day or two. The JUnit test cases will test model API and persistence through Hibernate mappings. Initially all of the persistence code will be failing and this is intentional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hopefully someone would finished up the entire JUnit test suite while I work on Hibernate mapping files to make the test cases pass.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content>

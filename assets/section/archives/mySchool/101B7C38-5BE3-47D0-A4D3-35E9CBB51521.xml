    <content>The customer has requested for a design review on the screen mockups in http://studygroup.wikispaces.com/sdd.html.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could Mr. Heo lead/arrange this review? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also this would be a good opportunity for Mr. Lee (if he could attend) to catch up and understand the work process of the system in preparation for Ruby/Watir testing. Same goes for Nariy for the User Manual development, I think.</content>

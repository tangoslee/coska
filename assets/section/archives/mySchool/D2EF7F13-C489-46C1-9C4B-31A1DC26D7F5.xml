            <content>If you think you are pretty much done, I will copy your Model project to Coska_MySchool project. I am still struggling with Action and Manager classes but, I think I can start combine Model and Manager classes at this weekend. If I have a problem with Model, I will let you know. Thank you for you all the hard works.</content>

    <content>Hi Suh,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My comments below. Hope this helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;User Management Subsystem&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;General &lt;br&gt;It would be better to separate the test cases into two different categories if possible: general user login vs. administrator login. For example, #3 &amp; #4 will apply for the administrator login only.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.3&lt;br&gt;As discussed, we could postpone this as a second phase item.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.1, 2.2&lt;br&gt;I assume this is a case where a user (including the administrator) changes his/her own password.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.3.2&lt;br&gt;Do we need a dialog&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;something like “New user ‘foo’ has been created successfully”?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.1 &lt;br&gt;What is “?????” ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.3.1&lt;br&gt;I think three editable fields are: “Is Active”, “Role”, and “Notes”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.3.1 &lt;br&gt;Once the fields are updated with new values, I would expect to see a button like “Update” or “Save” rather than “Edit Information”. This applies to 4.3.2 &amp; 4.3.2 as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student Management Subsystem&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.1&lt;br&gt;I will look at this screenshot again but clicking “New” buttons twice to add a new student sounds redundant to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.4.1&lt;br&gt;This is an important point. We will have to determine mandatory vs. optional fields for a student, e.g. last name, first name, home phone number, etc...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.4.1 &lt;br&gt;Can we use ‘first name and last name’ instead of ‘name‘?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.6&lt;br&gt;I don’t think we need this. Someone can confirm? If we need this, let’s make this a second phase item.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.2.1&lt;br&gt;Once the fields are updated with new values, I would expect to see a button like “Update” or “Save” rather than “Edit Student”. This applies to 3.2.2 &amp; 3.2.3 as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.2.2&lt;br&gt;Let’s define what would be editable fields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3.2.3&lt;br&gt;Don’t quite know what a status radio button is. Will look at the screenshot again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.3&lt;br&gt;Can we change ‘Add Consulting’ to something else?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;e.g. ‘Add Notes’, ‘Add Record’, or simply ‘Add’. This applies to 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.6.2 as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4.6.2&lt;br&gt;Can we change ‘Add Consulting’ to ‘Update Record’, ’Update Notes’, or ’Update’ if this case is about updating an existing consulting record?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Register a student for a term&lt;br&gt;Does ‘Register a student’ (without ’term’) better describe this case? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. Add courses for a student&lt;br&gt;Would ‘Register courses for a student’ be better?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the phrase ‘Add new courses’ is overloaded like below throughout the UI:&lt;br&gt;1) Adding generic courses in the course pool.&lt;br&gt;2) Adding&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;courses that is opened for a term (course history).&lt;br&gt;3) Adding courses for a student for a term. e.g. see 6.4.3, 6.4.4&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While technically correct (adding a new record to a data table), they would be very confusing from the usability point of view. We will have to come up with more clear and distinct terms for the above cases. One thing I can think of right now is to use “Register courses” for the above (3). This applies to 7.x as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. Print Transcripts&lt;br&gt;I think this could be pushed back until a second phase when we would understand this area better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;- Kihup&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content>

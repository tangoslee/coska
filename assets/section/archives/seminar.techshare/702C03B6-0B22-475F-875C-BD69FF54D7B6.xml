This allows easy creation and saving of these XML files in a Java oriented programming fashion. They typically require the configuration of additional classpath libraries that the generated classes rely on. This means that the user has to figure out how to invoke the generator and then also modify their classpath for their java project to allow successful compilation. For example, in Eclipse, each java project needs to modify their class path variable.&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To read the full content, download the attachment.&lt;br&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;br&gt;Area Code 809 Hoax &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Type: Scams and Shams&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Description:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This email, which is made to appear to have been sent out by AT&amp;T, purports that a scam is being perpetrated by certain phone companies through the long distance code 809. It alleges that dialing this long distance number can leave callers with unexpectedly huge bills. It explains that the code dials to the Bahamas and does not operate under US regulations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The code 809, which allegedly dials to the British Virgin Islands, actually belongs to the Dominican Republic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While AT&amp;T denies ever sending out this email, the scam it describes is apparently true, leading AT&amp;T to issue the following statement regarding the 809 Area Code Urban Legend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you receive such an email, keep in mind that while the modus operandi described does indeed take place, you should also be aware of the following: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not all phone numbers with 809 in the area code is part of this scam; most 809 numbers are legitimate, ordinary numbers. &lt;br&gt;This scam has been used with area codes aside from 809. &lt;br&gt;It is not, in fact, $2400 per minute; the figures involved with this scam have been greatly exaggerated over the years. &lt;br&gt;The average US consumer is unlikely to encounter the scam itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Original Message:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;809 Area Code &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We actually received a call last week from the 809 area code. The woman said "Hey, this is Karen. Sorry I missed you--get back to us quickly. Have something important to tell you." Then she repeated a phone number beginning with 809. We did not respond. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then this week, we received the following email: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: DON'T EVER DIAL AREA CODE 809, 284 AND 876 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY AT&amp;T. DON'T EVER DIAL AREA CODE 809 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This one is being distributed all over the US. This is pretty scary, especially given the way they try to get you to call. Be sure you read this and pass it on to all your friends and family so they don't get scammed! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MAJOR SCAM:&lt;br&gt;Don't respond to Emails, phone calls, or web pages which tell you to call an "809" Phone Number. This is a very important issue of Scam Busters because it alerts you to a scam that is spreading *extremely* quickly can easily cost you $2400 or more, and is difficult to avoid unless you are aware of it. We'd like to thank Verizon for bringing this scam to our attention. This scam has also been identified by the National Fraud Information Center and is costing victims a lots of money. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are lots of different permutations of this scam. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:&lt;br&gt;You will receive a message on your answering machine or your pager, which asks you to call a number beginning with area code 809. The reason you're asked to call varies. It can be to receive information about a family member who has been ill, to tell you someone has been arrested, died, to let you know you have won a wonderful prize, etc. In each case, you are told to call the 809 number right away. Since there are so many new area codes these days, people unknowingly return these calls. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you call from the US, you will apparently be charged $2425 per-minute. Or, you'll get a long recorded message. The point is, they will try to keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase the charges. Unfortunately, when you get your phone bill, you'll often be charged more than $24,100.00. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WHY IT WORKS:&lt;br&gt;The 809 area code is located in the British Virgin Islands (The Bahamas). The 809 area code can be used as a "pay-per-call" number, similar to 900 numbers in the US. Since 809 is not in the US, it is not covered by U.S. regulations of 900 numbers, which require that you be notified and warned of charges and rates involved when you call a pay-per-call" number. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is also no requirement that the company provide a time period during which you may terminate the call without being charged. Further, where as many U.S. homes that have 900 number blocking to avoid these kinds of charges, do not work in preventing calls to the 809 area code. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We recommend that no matter how you get the message, if you are asked to call a number with an 809 area code that you don't recognize just disregard the message. Be wary of email or calls asking you to call an 809 area code number. It's important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam, since trying to fight the charges afterwards can become a real nightmare. That's because you did actually make the call. If you complain, both your local phone company and your long distance carrier will not want to get involved and will most likely tell you that they are simply providing the billing for the foreign company. You'll end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they have done nothing wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please forward this entire message to your friends, family and colleagues to help them become aware of this scam. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sandi Van Handel&lt;br&gt;AT&amp;T Field Service Manager &lt;br&gt;(920)687-904 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</content>

    <content>I am updating company's web site.&lt;br&gt;All the title of the web site are image files.&lt;br&gt;However, I couldn't figure out which font it is, no way to connect the web solution company which initially created the web.&lt;br&gt;I only have gif format of images. How can I find out font and character info from gif image?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Is it possible?&lt;br&gt;Since every title and sub titles are image, search engines can't catch the content, is there any way to search engines catch the content by adding some comment or so ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content>

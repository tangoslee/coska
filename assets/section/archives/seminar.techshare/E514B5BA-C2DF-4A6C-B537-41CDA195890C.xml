    <content>I know this item should be under the'Carrer Tips' section but there is no \\&amp;quot;Write' coloumn on that section... Sorry!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check this site out.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By the way, this site is American site so all the dollar is USD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://www.salary.com/advice/layoutscripts/advl_display.asp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How comfortable are you with asking for your fair market value? The negotiation process is an opportunity to define, communicate, and achieve what you want....(from there site introductory text.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One more site that know is 'emergit.com' which is canadian site but it seems to me the site is down now... (too bad, eh?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;good luck everyone with your negotiationsssss.....</content>

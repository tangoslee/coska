    <content>Announcing the Code Jam Session for Toronto Android Users Group!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What: Code Jam Session&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When: Saturday, August 28, 2010 2:00 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where: Yorkville Media Centre&lt;br&gt;46 Hayden Street 4th Floor&lt;br&gt;Toronto, ON M4Y 1V8&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We'll be doing our first Code Jam session this coming Saturday. We'll be working on putting together a small "Toronto Android Users Group" application during the session. Please bring your laptop, and make sure Eclipse, the Android plugin, and the latest SDK (2.2) are installed. I would also suggest completing the tutorial at http://developer.android.com/resources/index.html before the session. You'll also need to know Java.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The session will be approximately 3 hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since we've never done a code jam session before, we'll be capping attendance to 12 people this time. Will definitely open up the session to more people in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please RSVP. Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RSVP to this Meetup:&lt;br&gt;http://www.torontoandroid.org/calendar/14508347/&lt;br&gt;</content>

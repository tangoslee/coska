    <content>We cannot offer you a position at this time. The US government has but a cap&lt;br&gt;on the amount of H1-B visas it will give out, and it will not be giving out&lt;br&gt;anymore H1-B visas until October of this year. If you are a permanent&lt;br&gt;resident of Canada, then you would need an H1-B to work here. Please contact&lt;br&gt;me in September if you are still interested in our company</content>

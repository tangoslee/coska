    <content>First of all, as far as I know, You should send a letter explaining the reason why you wouldn't be able to attend the ceremony to them.&lt;br&gt;Then you will be getting only one more chance to attend it later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, They will send you a letter informing when the ceremony date will be and also they will give you the information, in case that what will happen if you wouldn't be able to attend and what you have to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope it helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;캐나다 시민권 시험이 합격되었는데 선서식에 참석 못할 경우엔&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;예를 들어 여행중이라면 어떻게 되는지요.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;시민권을 받을수 있는지요?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;아니면 나중에 해야 되는지요?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;답 기다립니다.&lt;br&gt;</content>

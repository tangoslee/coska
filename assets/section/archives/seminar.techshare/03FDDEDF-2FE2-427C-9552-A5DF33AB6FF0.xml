    <content>&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A man comes into the ER and yells, \\&amp;quot;My wife's going to have her&lt;br&gt; baby in the cab!\\&amp;quot; I grabbed my stuff, rushed out to the cab, lifted &lt;br&gt; the lady's dress, and began to take off her underwear. &lt;br&gt; Suddenly I noticed that there were several cabs, and I was in the&lt;br&gt; wrong one.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dr. Mark MacDonald, San&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Antonio, TX&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At the beginning of my shift I placed a stethoscope on an elderly&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and slightly deaf female patient's anterior chest wall. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Big breaths, \\&amp;quot;I instructed. \\&amp;quot;Yes, they used to be,\\&amp;quot; remorsed the&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;patient.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dr. Richard Byrnes, Seattle, WA&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One day I had to be the bearer of bad news when I told a wife&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;that her husband had died of a massive myocardial infarct.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not more than five minutes later, I heard her reporting to &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the rest of the family that he had died of&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a \\&amp;quot;massive internal fart.\\&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Dr. Susan Steinberg, Manitoba, Canada&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was performing a complete physical, including the visual acuity&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;test.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I placed the patient twenty feet from the chart and began,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\\&amp;quot;Cover your right eye with your hand.\\&amp;quot; He read the 20/20 line &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; perfectly. \\&amp;quot;Now your left. \\&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Again, a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;flawless read. \\&amp;quot;Now both,\\&amp;quot; I requested. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There was silence.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He couldn't even read the large E &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;on the top line. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I turned and discovered that he had done exactly what I had asked;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;he was standing there with both his eyes covered.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was laughing too hard to finish the exam. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dr. Matthew Theodropolous, Worcester, MA&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;During a patient's two week follow-up appointment with his&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;cardiologist, he informed me, his doctor, that he was having &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;trouble with one of his medications.&lt;br&gt; \\&amp;quot;Which one?\\&amp;quot; I asked. \\&amp;quot;The patch. The nurse told me to put&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;on a new one every six hours and now I'm running out of &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;places to put it!\\&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I had him quickly undress and discovered what I hoped I wouldn't&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; see... Yes, the man had over fifty patches on his body!&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now the instructions include removal of the old patch before&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;applying a new one.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Dr. Rebecca St. Clair, Norfolk, VA&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;While acquainting myself with a new elderly patient, I asked, &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\\&amp;quot;How long have you been bedridden?\\&amp;quot; After a look of complete&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; confusion she answered...\\&amp;quot;Why, not for about twenty years &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; when my husband was alive.\\&amp;quot; Dr. Steven Swanson, Corvallis, OR&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I was caring for a woman from Kentucky and asked, \\&amp;quot;So how was your&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;breakfast this morning?\\&amp;quot; \\&amp;quot;It was very good, except for &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the Kentucky Jelly. I can't seem to get used to the taste,\\&amp;quot; the&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;patient replied. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I then asked to see the jelly&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and the woman produced a foil&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;packet labeled \\&amp;quot;KY Jelly.\\&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dr. Leonard Kransdorf, Detroit, MI&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A Nurse was on duty in the Emergency Room, when a young woman with&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;purple hair styled into a punk rocker Mohawk, sporting a variety&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of tattoos, and wearing strange clothing, entered. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was quickly determined that the patient had acute appendicitis,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;so she was scheduled for immediate surgery.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When she was completely disrobed on the operating table, the staff&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;noticed that her pubic hair had been dyed green, &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and above it there was a tattoo that read, \\&amp;quot;Keep off the grass.\\&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Once the surgery was completed, the surgeon wrote a short note on&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the patient's dressing, which said \\&amp;quot;Sorry, had to mow the lawn\\&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </content>

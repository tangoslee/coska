    <content>정원이 꽉찼던 토론토 .NET 코드 캠프가 신청자를 더 받는 다는 군요.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;참고로 토론토 .Net 코드 캠프는 무료이고요, &lt;br&gt;이번달 14일 토요일 하루동안 메뉴라이프 센터에서 열립니다.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;혹시 자리가 꽉차서 신청못하신분들은 빨리 한번 가보세요.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://www.torontocodecamp.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Great news!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have expanded the capacity of the Code Camp to accommodate 300 attendees! As such all people currently on the waitlist are invited to join us at the Code Camp. Registration is also open again to the public to join us for a short time so if you know anybody that wishes to join us let them know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are currently on the waitlist I need you to take yourself off the waitlist by logging in and clicking on the ‘De-Register’ button and then register yourself for the Code Camp by clicking on the “Register” button. This will indicate your intention to join us for this event. Please do this ASAP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content>

    <content>1. Motivate   Design your site to meet specific user needs and goals. Use motivators to draw different user "personae" into specific parts of your site. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. User task flow   Who are your users? What are their tasks and online environment? For a site to be usable, page flow must match workflow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Architecture &amp;#8211; it's 80% of usability   Build an efficient navigational structure. Remember &amp;#8211; if they can't find it in 3 clicks, they're gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Affordance means obvious   Make controls understandable. Avoid confusion between emblems, banners, and buttons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. Replicate   Why reinvent the wheel? Use ergonomically designed templates for the most common 8-12 pages. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. Usability test along the way   Test early in design using low-fidelity prototypes. Don't wait until the end when it's too late. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7. Know the technology limitations   Identify and optimize for target browsers and user hardware. Test HTML, JavaScript, etc. for compatibility. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. Know user tolerances   Users are impatient. Design for a 2-10 second maximum download. Reuse header graphics so they can load from cache. Avoid excessive scrolling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9. Multimedia &amp;#8211; be discriminating   Good animation attracts attention to specific information, then stops. Too much movement distracts, slowing reading and comprehension. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10. Use a stats package   Monitor traffic through your site. Which pages pique user interest? Which pages make users leave? Adjust your site accordingly&lt;br&gt;</content>

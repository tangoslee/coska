    <content>Have a small homework for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless you are concerned about having your biography published on the project homepage, send me your bio and photo (kihup.boo@gmail.com). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you do not have a photo, I will take one for you later. If you need an example, you may take a look at:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;http://eclipse.org/webtools/people/contributors.html#Kihup-Boo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It does not have to be in English.&lt;br&gt;Thanks in advance for your submission.</content>

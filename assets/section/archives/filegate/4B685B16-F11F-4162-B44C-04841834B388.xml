    <content>There seems to be consensus that our communication is not as good as we anticipate it to be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There would be obvious reasons for this. Many of us are just busy with our daily life so having frequent eyeball meetings may not be an option for some like me (OK, just an execuse).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hoped we could utilize Zeroboard but heard a rumor that most of us are afraid of posting anything here. I guess we are not comfortable with expressing our own thoughts. Nevertheless, healthy discussion and debates are essential to any successful projects. So...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would like to suggest that we have a regular MSN Messenger meeting once a week at night (like 10:00 PM) for about 30 minutes. Participation would not be mandatory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone could bring up any issues to be discussed. If you don't have any topic, you could just sit there (if you are interested) just to know what is going on. If you don't like typing, you could use voice (am i right here?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you think?&lt;br&gt;</content>

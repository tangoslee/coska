    <content>Hi Config team members,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As discussed in our previous meeting, we need a candidate API by tomorrow. This is not necessarily a final API as we understand so wrap up your work now and prepare for submission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are expecting to get the class files with:&lt;br&gt;classes, public attributes, and public methods commented so that they are ready for document generation. Any private fields and/or code implementation do not deserve out interest at this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email me your source files to kihup.boo@gmail.com.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will consolidate the works and prepare a design documentation for an external review.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks in advance.</content>

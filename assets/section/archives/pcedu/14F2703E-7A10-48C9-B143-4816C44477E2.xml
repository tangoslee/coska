    <content>&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;저같은 학생 또는 초보자가쓸때 Enterprise Architect 와 Enterprise Developer 중 어떤것이 나을까요?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;둘의 차이점을 간단히 설명 해 주세요. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both of them are for serious enterprise development and would not be relevant to you. I would recommend the Professional instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In summary, the Enterprise Developer adds the capabilities for effective team development, and the Architect adds analysis and design tools. So both of these tools may rather distract you from learning .NET.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They offer a license option for students so do some research on it to see how much discount you can get.</content>

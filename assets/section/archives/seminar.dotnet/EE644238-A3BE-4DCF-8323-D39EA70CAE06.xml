    <content>밑에 글은 microsoft job blog에서 퍼온글입니다.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether you're seeking employment or already have your dream job, it's always beneficial to learn new technical skills. Picking up knowledge that you can talk about in an interview and use on the job, can have a huge impact on an employer. But in a field that's constantly changing, how do you know which skills to hone in on? Here's an awesome list from TechRepublic's Justin James of the 10 skills developers will need in the next five years:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. One of the “Big Three” (.NET, Java, PHP)&lt;br&gt;2. Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) &lt;br&gt;3. Web development &lt;br&gt;4. Web services (REST, SOAP, JSON, XML) &lt;br&gt;5. Soft skills &lt;br&gt;6. One dynamic and/or functional programming language &lt;br&gt;7. Agile methodologies &lt;br&gt;8. Domain knowledge &lt;br&gt;9. Development “hygiene” &lt;br&gt;10. Mobile development&lt;br&gt;</content>

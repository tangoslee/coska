    <content>권혁준씨가 재미있는(?) 주제를 가지고 세미나를 준비하셨습니다.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8월 6일 7시&lt;br&gt;갤러리아 문화센타&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abstract:&lt;br&gt;The maximum matching algorithm is the first non-trivial polynomial time&lt;br&gt;algorithm. It was invented by Jack Edmonds,&lt;br&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Edmonds . First, we will talk about this&lt;br&gt;algorithm in bipartite graphs. And, then, we will move to non-bipartite&lt;br&gt;graphs. The key of this transition is that "the flower is shrinkable".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The talk is based on the paper: Jack Edmonds, Paths, Trees, and Flowers,&lt;br&gt;Canad. J. Math. 17, 449-467 (1965).</content>

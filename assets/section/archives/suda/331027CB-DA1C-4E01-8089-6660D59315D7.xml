    <content>A woman in her forties went to a plastic surgeon for a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;face-lift. The surgeon told her about a new procedure called "The Knob,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;where a small knob is placed on the back of a woman's head and can be&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;turned to tighten up her skin to produce the effect of a brand new facelift.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, the woman wanted "The Knob." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the years, the woman tightened the knob, and the effects were&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;wonderful-the woman remained young looking and vibrant.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After fifteen years, the woman returned to the surgeon with&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;two problems...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"All these years, everything has been working just fine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I've had to turn&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;the knob many times and I've always loved the results. But&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;now I've&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;developed two annoying problems: First, I have these&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;terrible bags under my eyes and the knob won't get rid of them."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The doctor looked at her closely and said, "Those aren't&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;bags, those are your breasts."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;She said, "Well, I guess there's no point in asking about&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the goatee." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Thank you and have a great day!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content>

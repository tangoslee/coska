    <content>Denver Airport:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This is hilarious. I wish I had the guts of this girl.&lt;br&gt;For all of you out there who've had to deal with an irate customer, this one is for you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;An award should go to the United Airlines gate agent in Denver for being smart and funny, while making her point, when confronted with a passenger who probably&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;deserved to fly as cargo.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A crowded United Airlines flight was canceled. A single agent was re-booking a long line of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;inconvenienced travelers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Suddenly an angry passenger pushed his way to the desk. He slapped his ticket on the counter and said "I&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;HAVE to be on this flight and it has to be FIRST CLASS." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The agent replied, "I am sorry, sir. I'll be happy to try to help you, but, I've got to help these folks first, and I'm sure we'll be able to work something out." &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The passenger was unimpressed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He asked loudly, so that the passengers behind him could hear,&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO I AM?"&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Without hesitating, the agent smiled and grabbed her public address microphone,&lt;br&gt;"May I have your attention please, " she began, her voice heard clearly throughout the terminal. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"We have a passenger here at Gate 14 WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS. &lt;br&gt;If anyone can&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;help him find his identity, please come to Gate 14."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically, the man glared at the United agent, gritted his teeth and swore "F*** You!". &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;Without&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;flinching, she smiled and said, "I'm sorry sir, you'll have to get in line for that too!"</content>

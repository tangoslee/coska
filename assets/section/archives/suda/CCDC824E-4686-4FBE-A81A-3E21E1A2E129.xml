    <content>Scene = loyalty program Cineplex.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I was able to see the Mist over the weekend for free.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sign up at http://www.scene.ca/home.aspx and get 250 points.&lt;br&gt;Print out your temp membership card&lt;br&gt;After sign up, visit http://www.scene.ca/promo/giftcard, login and put in the following code 1070721 for an additional 1,000 points.&lt;br&gt;Visit http://link.p0.com/u.d?IGoQtnSgKiCfaTvo=11 and use the code 2070721 for another 1,000 points.&lt;br&gt;When you hit the theatres, show them your temp member card, they’ll deduct 1,000 points / ticket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;광고아닙니다. &lt;br&gt;회사 동료가 보내온겁니다. 저도 해봤어요 ^^&lt;br&gt;뭐...영화 티켓 비싸지 않으니까 뭐 그렇게까지 하시는 분들은 말구요 ^^</content>

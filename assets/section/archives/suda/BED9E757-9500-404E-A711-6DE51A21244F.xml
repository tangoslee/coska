    <content> Here's a one-question IQ Test to help you decide how you should spend the rest of your day......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a mute who wants to buy a toothbrush. By imitating the action of brushing one's teeth, he successfully expresses himself to the shopkeeper and the purchase is done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, if there is a blind man who wishes to buy a pair of sunglasses, how should he express himself?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think about it first before scrolling down for the answer...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;He opens his mouth and says. "I would like to buy a pair of sunglasses"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you got this wrong - please turn off your computer and call it a day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;( I've got mine shutting down right now )</content>

    <content>Not the torturer will scare me&lt;br&gt;Nor the body's final fall&lt;br&gt;Nor the barrels of death's rifles&lt;br&gt;Nor the shadows on the wall&lt;br&gt;Nor the night when to the ground&lt;br&gt;The last dim star of pain, is held&lt;br&gt;But the blind indifference&lt;br&gt;Of a merciless unfeeling world&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lying in the burnt out shell&lt;br&gt;Of some Albanian farm&lt;br&gt;An old Babushka&lt;br&gt;Holds a crying baby in her arms&lt;br&gt;A soldier from the other side&lt;br&gt;A man of heart and pride&lt;br&gt;Breaks ranks, lays down his rifle&lt;br&gt;And kneels by her side&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He binds her wounds&lt;br&gt;He gives her food&lt;br&gt;And calms the crying child&lt;br&gt;She gives him absolution then&lt;br&gt;Across the great divide&lt;br&gt;He picks his way back through the broken&lt;br&gt;China of her life&lt;br&gt;And there at the kerb&lt;br&gt;The Samaritan Serb turns..&lt;br&gt;Turns and waves..

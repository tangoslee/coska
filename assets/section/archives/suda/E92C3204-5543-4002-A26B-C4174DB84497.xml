    <content>A guy is 70 years old and loves to fish. He was sitting in his boat the other day when he heard a voice say, 'Pick me up.' He looked around and couldn't see any one. He thought he was dreaming when he heard the voice say a gain, 'Pick me up.'&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;He looked in the water and there, floating on the top, was a frog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man said, 'Are you talking to me?'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The frog said, 'Yes, I'm talking to you. Pick me up then, kiss me and I'll turn into the most beautiful woman you have ever seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll make sure that all your friends are envious and jealous because I will be your bride!'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man looked at the frog for a short time, reached over, picked it up carefully, and placed it in his front breast pocket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the frog said, 'What, are you nuts? Didn't you hear what I said? I said kiss me and I will be your beautiful bride.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He opened his pocket, looked at the frog and said,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'Nah, at my age I'd rather have a talking frog.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With age comes wisdom. </content>

    <content>I only know of one couple that fits to a 't' and they've been married over&lt;br&gt;70 years... gives the rest of us a challenge ..doesn't it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each year he sent her roses,&lt;br&gt;and the note would always say,&lt;br&gt;I love you even more this year,&lt;br&gt;than last year on this day.&lt;br&gt;My love for you will always grow,&lt;br&gt;with every passing year."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She knew this was the last time&lt;br&gt;that the roses would appear.&lt;br&gt;She thought, he ordered roses&lt;br&gt;in advance before this day.&lt;br&gt;Her loving husband did not know,&lt;br&gt;that he would pass away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He always liked to do things early,&lt;br&gt;way before the time.&lt;br&gt;Then, if he got too busy,&lt;br&gt;everything would work out fine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She trimmed the stems and&lt;br&gt;placed them in a very special vase.&lt;br&gt;Then, sat the vase beside&lt;br&gt;the portrait of his smiling face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She would sit for hours,&lt;br&gt;In her husband's favorite chair.&lt;br&gt;While staring at his picture,&lt;br&gt;and the roses sitting there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year went by, and it was&lt;br&gt;to live without her mate.&lt;br&gt;With loneliness and solitude,&lt;br&gt;that had become her fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, the very hour,&lt;br&gt;as on Valentines before,&lt;br&gt;The doorbell rang, and there&lt;br&gt;were roses sitting by her door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She brought the roses in,&lt;br&gt;and then just looked at them in shock.&lt;br&gt;Then, went to get the telephone,&lt;br&gt;to call the florist shop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The owner answered, and she asked him,&lt;br&gt;if he would explain,&lt;br&gt;Why would someone do this to her,&lt;br&gt;causing her such pain?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I know your husband passed away,&lt;br&gt;more than a year ago,"&lt;br&gt;The owner said, "I knew you'd call,&lt;br&gt;and you would want to know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flowers you received today,&lt;br&gt;were paid for in advance.&lt;br&gt;Your husband always planned ahead,&lt;br&gt;he left nothing to chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a standing order,&lt;br&gt;that I have on file down here,&lt;br&gt;And he has paid, well in advance,&lt;br&gt;you'll get them every year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There also is another thing,&lt;br&gt;that I think you should know,&lt;br&gt;He wrote a special little card...&lt;br&gt;he did this years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, should ever I find out&lt;br&gt;that he's no longer here,&lt;br&gt;that's the card that should be sent&lt;br&gt;to you the following year."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She thanked him and hung up the phone,&lt;br&gt;her tears now flowing hard.&lt;br&gt;Her fingers shaking, as she slowly reached&lt;br&gt;To get the card.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inside the card, she saw that&lt;br&gt;he had written her a note.&lt;br&gt;Then, as she stared in total silence,&lt;br&gt;this is what he wrote...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Hello my love, I know it's been a year&lt;br&gt;since I've been gone.&lt;br&gt;I hope it hasn't been too hard&lt;br&gt;for you to overcome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know it must be lonely,&lt;br&gt;and the pain is very real.&lt;br&gt;Or if it was the other way,&lt;br&gt;I know how I would feel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The love we shared made everything&lt;br&gt;so beautiful in life.&lt;br&gt;I loved you more than words can say,&lt;br&gt;you were the perfect wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You were my friend and lover,&lt;br&gt;you fulfilled my every need.&lt;br&gt;I know it's only been a year,&lt;br&gt;but please try not to grieve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want you to be happy,&lt;br&gt;even when you shed your tears.&lt;br&gt;That is why the roses&lt;br&gt;will be sent to you for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you get these roses,&lt;br&gt;think of all the happiness,&lt;br&gt;That we had together,&lt;br&gt;and how both of us were blessed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have always loved you&lt;br&gt;and I know I always will.&lt;br&gt;But, my love, you must go on,&lt;br&gt;you have some living still.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please...try to find happiness,&lt;br&gt;while living out your days.&lt;br&gt;I know it is not easy,&lt;br&gt;but I hope you find some ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The roses will come every year,&lt;br&gt;and they will only stop,&lt;br&gt;When your door's not answered,&lt;br&gt;when the florist stops to knock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He will come five times that day,&lt;br&gt;in case you have gone out.&lt;br&gt;But after his last visit,&lt;br&gt;he will know without a doubt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To take the roses to the place,&lt;br&gt;where I've instructed him.&lt;br&gt;and place the roses where we are,&lt;br&gt;together once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes in life,&lt;br&gt;you find a special friend;&lt;br&gt;Someone who changes your life&lt;br&gt;just by being part of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone who makes you laugh&lt;br&gt;until you can't stop;&lt;br&gt;Someone who makes you believe&lt;br&gt;that there really is good in the world.&lt;br&gt;Someone who convinces you that there really is&lt;br&gt;an unlocked door just waiting for you to open it. &lt;br&gt;</content>

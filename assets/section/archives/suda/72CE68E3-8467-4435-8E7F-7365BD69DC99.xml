    <content>One Sunday morning, the pastor noticed little Alex standing in the foyer of the church staring up at a large plaque which was covered with names and small American flags mounted on either side of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The six-year old had been staring at the plaque for some time, so the pastor walked up, stood beside the little boy, and said quietly, "Good morning Alex."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Good morning Pastor," he replied, still focused on the plaque. "Pastor,what is this?"&lt;br&gt;The pastor said, "Well son, it's a memorial to all the young men and women who died in the service."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soberly, they just stood together, staring at the large plaque.&lt;br&gt;Finally, little Alex's voice, barely audible and trembling with fear asked, "Which service, the 8:30 or the 10:45?"&lt;br&gt;</content>

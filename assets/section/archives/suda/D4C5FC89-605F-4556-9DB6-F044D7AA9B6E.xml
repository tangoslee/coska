    <content>Hey you, &lt;br&gt;Out there in the cold, &lt;br&gt;Getting lonely, getting old, &lt;br&gt;Can you feel me? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey you, &lt;br&gt;Standing in the aisle, &lt;br&gt;With itchy feet and fading smile, &lt;br&gt;Can you feel me? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey you, &lt;br&gt;Don't help them to bury the light. &lt;br&gt;Don't give in without a fight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey you, &lt;br&gt;Out there on your own, &lt;br&gt;Sitting naked by the phone, &lt;br&gt;Would you touch me? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey you, &lt;br&gt;With your ear against the wall, &lt;br&gt;Waiting for someone to call out, &lt;br&gt;Would you touch me? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey you, &lt;br&gt;Would you help me to carry the stone? &lt;br&gt;Open your heart, I'm coming home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it was only fantasy. &lt;br&gt;The wall was too high, as you can see. &lt;br&gt;No matter how he tried he could not break free. &lt;br&gt;And the worms ate into his brain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey you, &lt;br&gt;Out there on the road, &lt;br&gt;Always doing what you're told, &lt;br&gt;Can you help me? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey you, &lt;br&gt;Out there beyond the wall, &lt;br&gt;Breaking bottles in the hall, &lt;br&gt;Can you help me? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey you, &lt;br&gt;Don't tell me there's no hope at all. &lt;br&gt;Together we stand, divided we fall. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE WALL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;embed src=http://www.borasoft.com/mymusic/-x-pink_floyd_-_hey_you.mp3 volume=0 autostart=true loop=0&gt;</content>

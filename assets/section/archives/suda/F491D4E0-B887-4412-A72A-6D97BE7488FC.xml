    <content>Psychological Test&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a story about a girl. While at the funeral of her mother, &lt;br&gt;she met a man whom she did not know. She thought he was amazing, &lt;br&gt;her dream guy, and she fell in love with him but never asked for &lt;br&gt;his number and could not find him after the funeral.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few days later the girl killed her sister.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Question:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What was her motive in killing her sister?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Give this some thought before you scroll down&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Answer:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was hoping that the guy would appear at the sister's funeral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you answered this correctly, you think like a psychopath. This was a&lt;br&gt;test that a famous American psychologist used to test if one has the&lt;br&gt;same mentality as a killer. Many arrested serial killers took this test&lt;br&gt;and answered it correctly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you didn't answer correctly, good for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you DID answer correctly, please let me know so I can take you off&lt;br&gt;my e-mail list.&lt;br&gt;</content>

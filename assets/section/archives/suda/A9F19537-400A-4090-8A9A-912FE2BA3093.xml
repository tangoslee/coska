    <content>Where's my job, in CANADA!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He started the day early having set his alarm clock (MADE IN JAPAN)&lt;br&gt;for 6 a.m. While his coffeepot (MADE IN CHINA) was perking, he shaved &lt;br&gt;with his electric razor (MADE IN HONG KONG). He put on a dress shirt &lt;br&gt;(MADE IN SRI LANKA), designer jeans (MADE IN SINGAPORE) and tennis &lt;br&gt;shoes (MADE IN KOREA). After cooking his breakfast in his new electric&lt;br&gt;skillet (MADE IN INDIA! ) he sat down with his calculator (MADE IN &lt;br&gt;MEXICO) to see how much he could spend today. After setting his watch &lt;br&gt;(MADE IN TAIWAN) to the radio (MADE IN INDIA) he got in his car (MADE &lt;br&gt;IN GERMANY) and continued his search for a good paying CANADIAN JOB.&lt;br&gt;At the end of yet another discouraging and fruitless day, Joe decided &lt;br&gt;to relax for a while. He put on his sandals (MADE IN BRAZIL) poured &lt;br&gt;himself a glass of wine (MADE IN FRANCE) and turned on his TV ! &lt;br&gt;(MADE IN INDONESIA), and then wondered why he can't find a good paying &lt;br&gt;job in .....CANADA.....&lt;br&gt;</content>

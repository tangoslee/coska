    <content>supposedly, these images can indicate the level of stress one can handle...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pictures attached are used to test the level of stress a person&lt;br&gt;can handle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The slower the pictures move, the better your ability of handling stress. Alleged criminals that were tested see them spinning around madly; however, senior citizens and kids see them standing still.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of these images are animated - they are perfectly static.</content>

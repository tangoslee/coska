    <content>On the turning away &lt;br&gt;From the pale and downtrodden &lt;br&gt;And the words they say &lt;br&gt;Which we won't understand &lt;br&gt;"Don't accept that what's happening &lt;br&gt;Is just a case of others' suffering &lt;br&gt;Or you'll find that you're joining in &lt;br&gt;The turning away" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a sin that somehow &lt;br&gt;Light is changing to shadow &lt;br&gt;And casting it's shroud &lt;br&gt;Over all we have known &lt;br&gt;Unaware how the ranks have grown &lt;br&gt;Driven on by a heart of stone &lt;br&gt;We could find that we're all alone &lt;br&gt;In the dream of the proud &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the wings of the night &lt;br&gt;As the daytime is stirring &lt;br&gt;Where the speechless unite &lt;br&gt;In a silent accord &lt;br&gt;Using words you will find are strange &lt;br&gt;And mesmerised as they light the flame &lt;br&gt;Feel the new wind of change &lt;br&gt;On the wings of the night &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No more turning away &lt;br&gt;From the weak and the weary &lt;br&gt;No more turning away &lt;br&gt;From the coldness inside &lt;br&gt;Just a world that we all must share &lt;br&gt;It's not enough just to stand and stare &lt;br&gt;Is it only a dream that there'll be &lt;br&gt;No more turning away? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;embed src=http://www.borasoft.com/mymusic/on_the_turning_away.wma volume=0 autostart=true loop=0&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content>

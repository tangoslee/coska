    <content>Why am I so tired???????????? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a couple years I've been blaming it on lack of sleep, not enough sunshine, and too much pressure from my job, ear wax build-up, poor blood or anything else I could think of.&lt;br&gt;But now I found out the real reason: I'm tired because I'm overworked!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's why:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The population of Canada is 30 million. - 11 million are retired. That leaves 19 million to do the work. &lt;br&gt;There are 5.5 millionin school, which leaves 13.5 million to do the work.&lt;br&gt;Of this there are 3 million employed by the federal government, leaving 10.5 million to do the work! &lt;br&gt;1 million are in the armed forces preoccupied with killing the Taliban. Which leaves 9.5 million to do the work. &lt;br&gt;Take from this total the 7 million people who work for Provincial and city&lt;br&gt;governments. And that leaves 2.5 million to do the work. &lt;br&gt;At any given time there are 476,000 people in hospitals. Leaving 2,024,000 to do the work. &lt;br&gt;Now, there are 1,211,998 people in prisons and 812,000 on Employment Insurance and Welfare. &lt;br&gt;That leaves just two people to do the work. You and me. And there you are sitting on your ass, at your computer, reading jokes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nice, real nice . . .</content>

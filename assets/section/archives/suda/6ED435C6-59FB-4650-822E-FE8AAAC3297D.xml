    <content>How I wish that's all I do each day.......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An Indian walks into a cafe with a shotgun in one hand and a bucket of buffalo manure in the other. He says to the waiter, "Me want coffee".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The waiter says, "Sure chief, coming right up".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He gets the Indian a tall mug of coffee, and the Indian drinks it down in one gulp, picks up the bucket of manure, throws it into the air, blasts it with the shotgun, then just walks out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next morning the Indian returns. He has his shotgun in one hand and a bucket of manure in the other. He walks up to the counter and says to the waiter, "Me want coffee".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The waiter says, "Whoa, Tonto. We're still cleaning up your mess from the last time you were here. What the heck was that all about, anyway?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Me in training for upper management position. Come in, drink coffee, shoot the shit, and disappear for rest of the day".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;추신: 이해하는데 한참걸렸네!!</content>

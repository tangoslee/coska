    <content>The question could have been more specific.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are interested in participating at a seminar (as the subject indicates), we are currently planning for 2003 education events. We could open a web site development course if there are enough interests. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to teach web site development skills, we are also looking for potential lecturers as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are a web developer and looking for a web developers' group (as the content indicates), we have a web team that developed this web site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But still I am not sure what 'web related' means. I just assumed it would be 'web site development' but I may be wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;안녕하세요.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;web site development 에 관련된 모임이 있는지 궁금하네요. 연락주시면 감사하겠습니다&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;</content>

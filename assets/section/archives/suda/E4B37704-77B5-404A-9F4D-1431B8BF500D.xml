    <content>This is a true story from the Japanese Embassy in US!!! (believe it or not)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few years ago,Prime Minister Mori was given some Basic English conversation training before he visits Washington and meets president Bill Clinton. The instructor told Mori "Prime Minister, when you shake hand with&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Clinton, please say 'how are you'. Then Mr Clinton should say,"Iam fine, and you?" Now you should say 'me too'. Afterwards we, translators, will do all the work for you." It looks quite simple, but the truth is.... When Mori met Clinton, he mistakenly said "Who Are You?". Mr Clinton was a bit shocked but still managed to react with humour: "Well, Iam Hilary's husband, haha..." Then Mori replied confidently "Me too, hahaha.." Then there was a long silent moment in the meeting room.&lt;br&gt;</content>

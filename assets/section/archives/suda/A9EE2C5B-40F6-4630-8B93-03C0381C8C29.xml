    <content>THREE MEN -- ONE GERMAN, ONE JAPANESE AND A HILLBILLY -- WERE SITTING NAKED IN A SAUNA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SUDDENLY THERE WAS A BEEPING SOUND. THE GERMAN PRESSED HIS FOREARM AND THE BEEP STOPPED. THE OTHERS LOOKED AT HIM QUESTIONINGLY.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"THAT WAS MY PAGER," HE SAID. " I HAVE A MICROCHIP UNDER THE SKIN OF MY ARM."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A FEW MINUTES LATER, A PHONE RANG. THE JAPANESE FELLOW LIFTED HIS PALM TO HIS EAR. WHEN HE FINISHED, HE EXPLAINED, "THAT WAS MY MOBILE PHONE. I HAVE A MICROCHIP IN MY HAND."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE HILLBILLY FELT DECIDEDLY LOW TECH. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, HE DECIDED HE HAD TO DO SOMETHING JUST AS IMPRESSIVE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HE STEPPED OUT OF THE SAUNA AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM. HE RETURNED WITH A PIECE OF TOILET PAPER HANGING FROM HIS BEHIND. THE OTHERS RAISED THEIR EYEBROWS AND STARED AT HIM. THE HILLBILLY FINALLY SAID,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "WELL, WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT. I'M GETTING A FAX."&lt;br&gt;</content>

    <content>One day, while walking to the store, I passed by a nursing home. On the &lt;br&gt;front lawn were six old ladies lying naked on the grass. I thought this was &lt;br&gt;a bit unusual, but continued on my way to the store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On my return trip, I passed the same nursing home with the same six old &lt;br&gt;ladies lying naked on the lawn. This time my curiosity got the best of me &lt;br&gt;and I went inside to talk to the manager.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"Do you know there are six ladies lying naked on your front lawn?"&lt;br&gt;"Yes," he said. "They're retired prostitutes, and they're having a yard &lt;br&gt;sale."</content>

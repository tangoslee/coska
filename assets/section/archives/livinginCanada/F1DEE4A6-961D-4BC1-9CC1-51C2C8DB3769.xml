    <content>&lt;br&gt;The Woman's Rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1. The Female ALWAYS Makes the rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#2. The Rules are subject to change at any time without prior notification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#3. No male can possibly know all the rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#4. If the Female suspects the male knows the rules, she MUST IMMEDIATELY change some or all the Rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#5. The Female is NEVER WRONG.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#6. If the Female is wrong, It is Because of a flagrant misunderstanding which was a direct result of something the male did or said wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#7. If rule #6 applies, the male MUST Apologize Immediately for causing the misunderstanding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Female can Change Her Mind at any given point in time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The male must NEVER change his mind without express written consent from the Female.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#10. The Female has EVERY RIGHT to be angry or upset at any time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#11. The male Must remain calm at all times, UNLESS the Female wants him to be angry or upset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#12. The Female must Under NO Circumstances LET the Male know whether or not she wants him to be angry or upset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#13.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Any attempt to document these rules could Result in Bodily Harm.&lt;br&gt;</content>

    <content>Hello all,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could anyone let me know about how to get to CFB Borden from Toronto airport or Korean town ? by bus or taxi ? I'm going to attend to the graduation parade of the basic military course. how far from Toronto ? and how long will it take to there ? the cheaper place to stay for 2 days (Mar 22nd to 24th) ? I really appreciate the people living in Toronto, who gave informations to my questions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a country man from Halifax&lt;br&gt; </content>

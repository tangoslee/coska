    <content>I found this site from Google, and it seems to contain pretty much of necessary info for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://www.borden.forces.gc.ca/cfb_borden/index_e.asp&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's about 100 km north of Toronto - i.e. not much related with Toronto at all. The only thing I know about Simcoe County is that I went on a summer camping trip there a few years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There seems to be two easy options: either use their Taxi service or rent a car from the Pearson airport, whichever costs less. You might want to call now and make a reservation either way. Also it may be a good idea to order a map (about $7.50) for your driving if you choose so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope this helps. &lt;br&gt;P.S. There is a COSKA annual meeting on 3/25 so you may attend if you'd like. It is posted on our homepage as you may already know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Hello all,&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Could anyone let me know about how to get to CFB Borden from Toronto airport or Korean town ? by bus or taxi ? I'm going to attend to the graduation parade of the basic military course. how far from Toronto ? and how long will it take to there ? the cheaper place to stay for 2 days (Mar 22nd to 24th) ? I really appreciate the people living in Toronto, who gave informations to my questions. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;a country man from Halifax&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;br&gt;</content>

    <content>Just before giving a lavish party at his estate, a tycoon had his swimming pool filled with poisonous snakes. &#xD;
He called the guests together and announced, “To anyone brave enough to swim across this pool, I will give the choice of a thousand acres of my oil fields, 10,000 head of cattle or my daughter's hand in marriage.” &#xD;
No sooner were his words spoken than a young man plunged in, swam across the pool and climbed out--unscathed but breathless. &#xD;
“Congratulations!” the tycoon greeted him. “Do you want my oil fields?” &#xD;
“No!” gasped the guest. &#xD;
“The 10,000 head of cattle?” &#xD;
“No!” the young man shouted. &#xD;
“Well, how about my daughter's--” &#xD;
“No!” &#xD;
“You must want something,” said the puzzled host. &#xD;
“I just want to know the name of the guy who pushed me in!” &#xD;

    <content>Cell Phone Numbers Go Public this month.&#xD;
REMINDER .... All cell phone numbers are being released to telemarketing &#xD;
Companies and you will start to receive sale calls. &#xD;
YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR THESE CALLS &#xD;
To prevent this, call the following number from your cell phone: &#xD;
1 866-580-3625 or 888-382-1222. &#xD;
It is the National DO NOT CALL list. It will only take a minute of your time. &#xD;
It blocks your number for five (5) years. You must call from the cell phone &#xD;
Number you want to have blocked. You cannot call from a different phone number. &#xD;
Or you can do it online at http://www.lnnte-dncl.gc.ca &#xD;
HELP OTHERS BY PASSING THIS ON TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS.. It takes about 20 seconds </content>

    <content>Hi,&#xD;
&#xD;
 I think you are gonna to the US in near soon.&#xD;
 You can change the Ontario's driver license to some states in US. But you should check the rules of California, because all of states have their own rules for that.&#xD;
 All of the driver license related jobs are serviced by DMV, department of motor vehicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
 You can go to "http://www.dmv.ca.gov/" and check it.&#xD;
&#xD;
 Good luck.</content>

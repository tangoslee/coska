    <content>This is the one the movie you should watch.&#xD;
It had very good review. It was the best box office movie of the last month.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the movie about 30 year old single greek lady. She is from very traditional greek family in Chicago. She never dated other than greeks. But she met good old American boy and fell on love. There are family confilct and consequently a lot of funny things happen along the way. I would not not tell all the story of the movie but watch it. It is very entertaining and educational about immigrant family.&#xD;
&#xD;
There are three things I liked&#xD;
- Educate something about Greek&#xD;
   Three things Greek girl should to do&#xD;
    - marry good Greek old&#xD;
    - have many greek babies as possible&#xD;
    - feed you family well&#xD;
   Being Greek is not much different being Korean&#xD;
- Compare Greek and English family&#xD;
   You would not believe what much cultual differences there are.&#xD;
   Greek : Big family and family member gets into other memebr life without asking. happy and loud&#xD;
   English : Calm and logical&#xD;
- Something about immigrant family from Europe  &#xD;
  We are not better different from Greek family&#xD;
&#xD;
Compare with your experience and also imagine yourself when your kids are getting married.&#xD;

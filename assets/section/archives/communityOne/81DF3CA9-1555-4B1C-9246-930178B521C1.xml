    <content>Just a reminder that Ontario’s ban on hand-held devices while driving will take effect on October 26.  Ontario joins more than 50 countries worldwide and a growing number of North American jurisdictions that have similar distracted driving legislation including Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, California and New York. &#xD;
There will be a 3-month period of educating drivers about the new rules and then, as of February 1, 2010, police will start issuing fines (up to $500) for drivers who talk, text, type, dial or email using hand-held devices.  The government has said hands-free devices aren't covered by the legislation, but they are not recommended for use while driving.&#xD;
Police, paramedics and firefighters will continue to be allowed to use hand-held devices while on the job. All drivers may use hand-held devices to call 911, when they have pulled off the road or are legally parked.</content>

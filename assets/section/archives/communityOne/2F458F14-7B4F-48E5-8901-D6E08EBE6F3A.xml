    <content>The issue was the version of .Net Web Service Extension (WSE) Library.&#xD;
&#xD;
We changed the libraray back to ver 1.0 from 2.0 and it worked out!&#xD;
The way of soap message creation was different between WSE 1.0 and 2.0 and&#xD;
my WebSphere environment was ok with WSE 1.0 library.&#xD;
&#xD;
What I guess is this:&#xD;
&#xD;
The latest version WSE 2.0 is based on the standard of "oasis 2004-01" while&#xD;
the WebSphere test environment 5.1 I tried is based on "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2003/06/" so the WebSphere may have not understood the new "oasis" way of tags or the naming space of the tags.&#xD;
&#xD;
The initial version WSE 1.0 is based on 2002-07 from xmlsoap.org so the WebSphere may stil cover this backward thing.&#xD;
&#xD;
I appreciate all your interests and suggestion on this again.&#xD;

    <content>Hi Brendan, I hope you are having a great day today!  I am wondering if you can help me. &#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
I have an opportunity for a Junior Java J2EE Developer.  This role is joining an existing team and we want a recent graduate in order to properly slot the skill set for future growth and career development.  The team already has some 5+ year experienced Developers and this new role is graded lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
The keys are a person with a recent (2005-'09) Computer Science degree, Java J2EE and PL/SQL exp., including JSP, EJB, Struts, Javascript, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Brendan, who do you know that I can talk to about this?  Please think of anyone who fits this profile, even if they are not looking for a job themselves -&gt; they may have a classmate they know who would be interested!&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you for your consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Regards,&#xD;

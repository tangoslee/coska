    <content>I will be attending the softskill training called "Communication with diplomacy and professianlism" at Aug 14th and 15th.&#xD;
probably it is worth while after until then. I've prepared some materials but above training is the last missing puzzle for me.&#xD;
&#xD;
We could have the meeting prior to that but I will be more comfortable afterward&#xD;

Venue : Thomas Lee's residence (summer office or basement)&#xD;
Date and Time : Aug 16th 8:30pm &#xD;

&gt; My Suggestion is so far we have been concentrated in technical skils only. However we have not discussed on soft skills in order to acquire job and how to survive/advance from current job.&#xD;
&gt; &#xD;
&gt; We are busy trying to get tecnical knowledge. If we think of our daily work activities, technical portions are a lot less than soft skills such as meeting participation, preparing proposal, tech support, documentation, e-mail writing, phone conversation. &#xD;
&gt; &#xD;
&gt; Let's have the seminars about soft skills. We could acquire different methods and background. Also different experiences.&#xD;
&gt; &#xD;
&gt; List of Soft Skills&#xD;
&gt; ----------------------&#xD;
&gt; - Meeting Participation&#xD;
&gt; - Leadership&#xD;
&gt; - New proposal Generation&#xD;
&gt; - Presentation&#xD;
&gt; - etc&#xD;
&gt; &#xD;
&gt; Let's me know or set the date using chating fuction on COMM1 </content>

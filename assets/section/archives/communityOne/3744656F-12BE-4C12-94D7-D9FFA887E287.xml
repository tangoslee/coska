    <content>A woman was having an affair during the day while her husband was at work.  One day she was in bed with her boyfriend when she heard her husband's car pull in the driveway. She yelled at the boyfriend, "Hurry! Grab your clothes and jump out the window, my husband's home early!" &#xD;
&#xD;
The boyfriend looked out the window and said, "It's raining out there!"  She said, "If my husband catches us in here, he'll kill us both!"  So the boyfriend grabs his clothes and jumps out the window. As he began running down the street, he discovered he had run right in the middle of a town marathon, so he started running along beside the others. Being naked, with his clothes tucked under his arm, he tried to "blend in" as best he could.&#xD;
&#xD;
One of the runners asked him, "Do you always run in the nude?" He answered, while gasping for air, "Oh yes, it feels so free having the air blow over your skin while you are running."&#xD;
The next runner then asked the nude man, "Do you always run carrying your clothes on your arm?"  The nude man answered breathlessly, "Oh, yes, that way I can get dressed right at the end of the run and get in my car to go home!"&#xD;
A third runner asked, "Do you always wear a condom when you run?" Without missing a beat he replied, "Only when it's raining."&#xD;

His friend Doug stops him and asks, "Hey Bob! Whacha get the case of beer&#xD;

Canadian Joke #2&#xD;
-----------------&#xD;
An Ontarian wanted to become a Newfie. He went to a neurosurgeon and asked&#xD;
"Is there anything you can do to me that would make me into a Newfie?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Sure, it's easy." replied the neurosurgeon. "All I have to do is cut out&#xD;
1/3 of your brain, and you'll be a Newfie."&#xD;
The Ontarian was very pleased, and immediately underwent the operation.&#xD;
However, the surgeon's knife slipped, and instead of cutting out 1/3 of the&#xD;
patient's brain, the surgeon accidentally cut out 2/3 of the patient's&#xD;
brain. He was terribly remorseful, and waited impatiently beside the&#xD;
patient's bed as the patient recovered from the anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
As soon as the patient was conscious, the neurosurgeon said to him, "I'm&#xD;
terribly sorry, but there was a ghastly accident. Instead of cutting out 1/3&#xD;
of your brain, I accidentally cut out 2/3 of your brain."&#xD;
The patient replied "Qu'est-ce que vous avez dit, monsieur?"&#xD;
&#xD;

Canadian Joke #5&#xD;
-----------------&#xD;
One day an Englishman, an American, and a Canadian walked into a pub&#xD;
together. They proceeded to each buy a pint of Molson Canadian. Just as they&#xD;
were about to enjoy their beverage three flies landed in each  of their&#xD;
pints.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Englishman pushed his beer away from him in disgust.&#xD;
&#xD;
The American fished the offending fly out of his beer and continued drinking&#xD;
it as if nothing had happened.&#xD;
The Canadian picked the fly out of his drink and started shaking it over the&#xD;
pint, yelling, "SPIT IT OUT, SPIT IT OUT YOU S-O-B!!!"&#xD;

Canadian Joke # 7&#xD;
-----------------&#xD;
An American, a Scot and a Canadian were in a terrible car accident. They&#xD;
were all brought to the same emergency room, but all three of them died&#xD;
before they arrived. Just as they were about to put the toe tag on the&#xD;
American, he stirred and opened his eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
Astonished, the doctors and nurses present asked him what happened.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, "said the American, "I remember the crash, and then there was a&#xD;
beautiful light, and then the Canadian and the Scot and I were standing at&#xD;
the gates of heaven. St. Peter approached us and said that we were all too&#xD;
young to die, and that for a donation of $50, we could return to the earth.&#xD;
So of course I pulled out my wallet and gave him the $50, and the next thing&#xD;
I knew I was back here."&#xD;
&#xD;
"That's amazing!" said one of the doctors, "But what happened to the other&#xD;
two?"&#xD;
"Last I saw them," replied the American, "the Scot was haggling over the&#xD;
price and the Canadian was waiting for the government to pay for his."&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Canadian Joke # 8&#xD;
-----------------&#xD;
The Canadian Transportation Safety Board recently divulged that they had&#xD;
covertly funded a project with an auto maker for the past five years,&#xD;
whereby the auto makers were installing black boxes in four-wheel drive&#xD;
pick-up trucks in an effort to determine, in fatal accidents, the&#xD;
circumstances in the last 15 seconds before the crash.&#xD;
&#xD;
They were surprised to find in almost all areas of Canada, the last words of&#xD;
drivers in 61.2 percent of fatal crashes were, "Oh, God!" Only the Nova&#xD;
Scotia's were different, where 89.3 percent of the final words were: "Hold&#xD;
my beer and watch this".&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Never Underestimate the Power of a Woman&#xD;
-----------------------------------------&#xD;
There were 11 people-ten were men and one woman- hanging onto a rope that&#xD;
came down from a helicopter.&#xD;
&#xD;
They all decided that one person should get off because if they didn't the&#xD;
rope would break and everyone would die.&#xD;
&#xD;
No one could decide who should go so finally the woman gave a really&#xD;
touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the others,&#xD;
because women were used to giving up things for their husbands and children,&#xD;
giving in to men, and not receiving anything in return.&#xD;
&#xD;
When she finished speaking, all the men started clapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
Never underestimate the power of a woman.&#xD;

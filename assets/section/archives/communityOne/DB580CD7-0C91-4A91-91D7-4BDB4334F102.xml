    <content>Hey You handsome…&#xD;
&#xD;
First of all if I had offended anybody last night, I am very sorry. Of course good intention does not cure bad behavior. It’s the reason why I am asking your pardon. You have seen me in the action last night. That is I. That is my color. I do not totally like what and how I behavior. But I performed the best considering the circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
Scott told me the few not to do during the day. I did not behavior like Scott asked. There are the couple reasons. Scott was asking that I should act like good moral citizen. But I am not a good citizen. I am a rebel on my own way. I deliver better with my radical way. &#xD;
&#xD;
I am not saying I will not try exercise soft skills. But you have to be patient. I will come around. But do not expect I will become what you ask or wish for. Because if I become a moral citizen, probably I will lose my edge.&#xD;
&#xD;
However it should not stop giving me your feedbacks. Feedbacks help me in the several ways. First of all it is the good reminder. Secondly it could be good measurement tool. I could see myself very objectively. Thirdly but not the least I want to be cared. When you care for someone, you will give the persons the feedback with love.&#xD;
&#xD;
Comm. One : I am waiting and ready to listen&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Sincerely Yours&#xD;
&#xD;
From your best friend&#xD;

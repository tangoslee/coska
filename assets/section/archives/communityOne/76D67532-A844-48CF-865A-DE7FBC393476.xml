    <content>Dear T,&#xD;
&#xD;
On behalf of Versant, I'm pleased to invite you to a dinner event hosted by Versant &amp; IBM.  The event starts with a technical seminar conducted by Versant's CTO, Keiron McCammon, who co-authored the "Core JDO" book.  This will be followed by dinner and some fun at the Second City comedy club (see details below).  As seating is limited, please register today at the following url.&#xD;

&#xD;
If you cannot attend but are still interested in the JDO (JavaDataObjects) standard, please send me a note and I can arrange a informal telecon/webinar with one of our system engineers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sincerely,&#xD;
&#xD;
Jim&#xD;

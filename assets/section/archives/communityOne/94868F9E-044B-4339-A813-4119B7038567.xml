    <content>What we need is someone who is a superb with J2EE. They must have solid experience with distributed programming (CORBA &amp; RMI). Also in the context of J2EE the experience should be in controlling network equipment (i.e. protocols, subscribers, policies, etc.) rather than web applications development.&#xD;
&#xD;
Any integration with provision system, billing, and account management systems is also a big plus as is RADIUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
Please send me your updated resume in Word format. Else I would appreciate if you could refer your friend or colleague to contact me ASAP.&#xD;

Thanks,&#xD;

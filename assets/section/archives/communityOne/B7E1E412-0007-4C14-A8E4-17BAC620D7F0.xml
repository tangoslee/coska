i installed DVD drive with PowerDvd software on my PC.&#xD;
i feel it is excellent to do English Practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
I can enjoy a lot of movies that i borrowed from library, and can check dialogue.&#xD;
if i can not hear dialogues, Repeat function can be used unlimitedly.&#xD;
&#xD;
The DVD drive is LG product and price was 59 dollars and PowerDVD was 8 dollars.&#xD;

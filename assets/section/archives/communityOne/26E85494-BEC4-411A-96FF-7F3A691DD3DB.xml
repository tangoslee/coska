            <content>I had my 25 years old furnace replaced with anothe Lenox furnace. The installer did an excellent job. They are Lenox owned. Price seems to be reasonable. And the furnace itself is very quiet and working well. Here is the dealer in Oakville. If you need more info, please contact me.&#xD;

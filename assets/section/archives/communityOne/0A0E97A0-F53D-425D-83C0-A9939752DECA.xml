Sun Microsystems has released a test version of a new "connector" software module for its server version of Java, the company announced Monday. The beta version of the connector software allows heavy-duty business programs, such as SAP's R/3, to connect to Java 2 Enterprise Edition 1.3 software. &#xD;
&#xD;
J2EE, which 25 companies have licensed from Sun, is used chiefly to run complicated e commerce sites. The software provides a standard way to take advantage of server software such as e-mail or databases.&#xD;

    <content>Hi all.&#xD;
I'm in Korea now and in progress of emigration to Canada.&#xD;
I have been a member of Mr. Scott's site, but I have hardly visited there recently.&#xD;
Now I'm working as a web developer using java,jsp and so on. I wish to be a IT consultant.&#xD;
Anyway I am grateful to who made this site and gave me a chance to join this group.&#xD;
I'd be glad if I will be any help to you.&#xD;
Thanks.</content>

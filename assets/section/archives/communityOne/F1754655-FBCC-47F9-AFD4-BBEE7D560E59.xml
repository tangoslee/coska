    <content>My Suggestion is so far we have been concentrated in technical skils only. However we have not discussed on soft skills in order to acquire job and how to survive/advance from current job.&#xD;
&#xD;
We are busy trying to get tecnical knowledge. If we think of our daily work activities, technical portions are a lot less than soft skills such as meeting participation, preparing proposal, tech support, documentation, e-mail writing, phone conversation. &#xD;
&#xD;
Let's have the seminars about soft skills. We could acquire different methods and background. Also different experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
List of Soft Skills&#xD;
----------------------&#xD;
- Meeting Participation&#xD;
- Leadership&#xD;
- New proposal Generation&#xD;
- Presentation&#xD;
- etc&#xD;
&#xD;
Let's me know or set the date using chating fuction on COMM1 </content>

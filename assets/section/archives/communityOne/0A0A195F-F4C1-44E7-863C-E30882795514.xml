   The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a&#xD;
   timely response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to&#xD;
   complete the request.&#xD;

    <content>Does anybody know this error on browser?&#xD;
&#xD;
I meet the followed error message on my browser very often.&#xD;
I am using Rogers Hi-speed Internet and called to complain Rogers DNS Server to Rogers customer service.&#xD;
But she said nothing wrong in Rogers System and mentioned Socket file problem of my Windows 2000. Is it possible to occur the error message if Windows 2000 is broken in somewhere?&#xD;
Please, let me know if somebody knows it.&#xD;
Thanks.&#xD;

    <content>Hello All....&#xD;
&#xD;
My family had new family member, Woo Ju, in last Nov. We love Fluffy but due to new arrival of Woo Ju Fluffy became odd dog out situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
There are three main reasons for the request&#xD;
--------------------------------------------&#xD;
- My wife, Dianne, is quite busy with a new born&#xD;
- Fluffy's barking habit is not coping with Woo Ju's sleeping habit&#xD;
- My daught, Anabel, is busy with her teenager life.&#xD;
&#xD;
I am looking for temp home for nice kind dog Fluffy. After three or four months we will decide the future of Fluffy's permanent home.&#xD;
&#xD;
Fluffy : 5 years old nice small size Shiu Zhu&#xD;
         very gentle and lovely eyes&#xD;

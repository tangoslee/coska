            <content>로저스 홈폰 2년째 쓰는데요 아무 불편없어요 지금까지. 그런데 로저스홈폰이 VOIP인지는 모르겠네요. 참 가격은 벨이랑 별 차이 없는듯.</content>

    <content>I am using Cogeco cable services for Internet and Cable TV. I am considering Cogeco cable Home Phone as well. In terms of price, it's better than Bell due to discount. &#xD;
My question is related to whether additional phone equipments are needed or any issues ( e.g voice quality, reliability etc). I think most of the GTA areas are using Rogers than Cogeco. Rogers experience will be similar.&#xD;

Your input will be appreciated.</content>

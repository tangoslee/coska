    <content>First of all I like to thank to Scott’s well prepared seminar. I wish that more members had attended. It was typical Scott’s seminar well plan, prepared and presented. I strongly suggest we should look into “Struts Framework”.&#xD;
&#xD;
Reasons if Comm One ever get Java projects &#xD;
- good marketing tool&#xD;
- excellent project management tools&#xD;
as long as each member understands the framework, easy task delegation&#xD;
- easier maintenance&#xD;
- oce customer is committed, customers are playing at our home ground. Framework is continuous changing. Potential projects&#xD;
&#xD;
Thanks Scott for excellent seminar &#xD;

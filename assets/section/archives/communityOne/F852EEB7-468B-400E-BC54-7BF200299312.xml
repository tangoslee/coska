    <content>Tama was stopped by a Department Of Conservation officer, somewhere near Taupo recently , with two buckets of fish leaving a stream well known for its fishing. &#xD;
The officer asked him, &#xD;
"Do you have a license to catch those fish?" &#xD;
Tama replied "These are my pet fish." &#xD;
"Pet fish!?" the officer asked. &#xD;
"Yes sir. Every night I take these fish down to the&#xD;
stream and let them swim around for a while.&#xD;
I whistle and they jump back into the buckets, and I take them home." &#xD;
"That's a bunch of crap! Fish can't do that!" &#xD;
Tama looked at the officer for a moment, and then said "Here I'll show you, it really works." &#xD;
"O.K. I've got to see this!" &#xD;
The officer was curious now. &#xD;
Tama poured the fish into the stream and stood and waited.&#xD;
After several minutes, the officer turned to him and said "Well?"&#xD;
"Well, What?" Tama responded.&#xD;
"When are you going to call them back?" &#xD;
The officer prompted.&#xD;
"Call who back?" Tama asked.&#xD;
"The fish." replied the officer.&#xD;
"What fish?" asked Tama.</content>

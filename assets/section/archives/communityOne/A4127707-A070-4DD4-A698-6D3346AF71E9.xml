U.S. still running on one cylinder&#xD;

...So far, it looks as though anything tied to retail or housing and related sectors could do fairly well, but the rest of the market is a question mark. Telecom remains a black hole, judging by Lucent and Nortel, and Honeywell's warning certainly doesn't bode well for the industrial sector...&#xD;
&#xD;
지금까지는 Retail 이나 Housing 그리고 그와 관련된 분야 꽤 잘 나갈 것으로 보이나 그외 시장은 의심스러움. Telecom(시장)은 여전히 black hole로 남아있음.  Lucent와 Nortel의 (실적저조)경고로 판단컨데 다른 산업분야 역시 좋은 징조는 보이지 않음.&#xD;

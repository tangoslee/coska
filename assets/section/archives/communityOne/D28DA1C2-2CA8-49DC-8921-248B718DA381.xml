    <content>I had watched two movies over the weekend.&#xD;
Both of them were excellent. I strongly recommend.&#xD;
&#xD;
"About Schmidt" staring Jack Nicholson&#xD;
   personal soul searching story by a retired insurance company executive. Simple story with profound meaning of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
"The Pianist" directed by Roman Polanski&#xD;
   World War II Holocaust story of a pianist. Deep humanism&#xD;
&#xD;
About Roman Polanski : born in Paris but originally Polish&#xD;
every one of them is entertaining and educational about what is happening in the world.&#xD;

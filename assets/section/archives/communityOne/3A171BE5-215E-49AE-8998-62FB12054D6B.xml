&gt; This is the actual radio conversation of a US naval ship with Canadian authorities off the coast of Newfoundland in October 1995.  Radio conversation released by the chief of naval operations, 10-10-95.&#xD;
&gt;&#xD;
&gt; CANADIANS:  Please divert your course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision.&#xD;
&gt;&#xD;
&gt; AMERICANS:  Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the north to avoid a collision.&#xD;
&gt;&#xD;
&gt; CANADIANS:  Negative.  You will have to divert your course 15 degrees to the south to avoid a collision.&#xD;
&gt;&#xD;
&gt; AMERICANS:  This is the captain of a US Navy ship.  I say again, divert YOUR course.&#xD;
&gt;&#xD;
&gt; CANADIANS:  No, I say again, you divert YOUR course.&#xD;
&gt;&#xD;
&gt; AMERICANS:  This is the Aircraft Carrier US LINCOLN, the second largest ship in the United States Atlantic Fleet.  We are accompanied by three Destroyers, three Cruisers and numerous support vessels.  I DEMAND that you change your course 15 degrees north.  I say again, that's one-five degrees north, or counter-measures will be undertaken to ensure the safety of this ship.&#xD;
&gt;&#xD;
&gt; CANADIANS:  This is a Lighthouse.  Your call.&#xD;

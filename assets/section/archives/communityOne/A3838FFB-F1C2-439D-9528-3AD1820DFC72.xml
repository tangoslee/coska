    <content>Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today and am happy to hear that things are working out at TD.&#xD;
As I mentioned I will be specializing in the Java Development space and would love to be a resource for you or anyone you believe may benefit from my services. Currently we have a role with the Dominion of Canada on the go and we must present by Thursday Feb. 17th.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Thank you again for your time&#xD;
 &#xD;
Best regards&#xD;

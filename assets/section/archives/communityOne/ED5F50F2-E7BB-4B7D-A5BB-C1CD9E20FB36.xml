    <content>There was the first soft Skills seminar last summer. I had promised that I am going to have the second session. I think I am ready to deliver like I had promised.&#xD;
&#xD;
I like to combine different topics into a presentation. I have been running for some time and also took the class from the community center "How to Run". The class consisted of 10 different sessions. That meant I need to be with the total strangers for 10 different occasions. I like to present what transpired during 10 weeks. I like to compare  my experience with other situation.&#xD;

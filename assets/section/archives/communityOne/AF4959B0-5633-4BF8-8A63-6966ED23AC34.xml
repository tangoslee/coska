Yes, you can come from Britania. Now there is new traffic signal set up from this direction.&#xD;

장소 : 1228 Garcia st. Mississauga 905-814-6170 (최덕선 자택)&#xD;
       (Britannia &amp; Creditview southeast side)&#xD;
       I would recommend you to come from CreditView since there is no traffic sign from Britania&#xD;
&#xD;
       1.See the Duval rd(new) on your right side before tthe Britania and turn to the right(east), and soon you will meet the WhiteHorn&#xD;
       2.At the WhiteHorn turn to the left(north), you wouldn't miss the Garcia st on your left side.&#xD;

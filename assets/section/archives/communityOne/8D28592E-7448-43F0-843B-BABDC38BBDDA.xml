    <content>There are 4 kinds of groups I met&#xD;
&#xD;
- Rehab type : heart operation, some kind of health problem&#xD;
- old aged home type : plain old folks&#xD;
- overweight type : out of shape people&#xD;
- regular : very few&#xD;
&#xD;
*Comments : Even good swimmers are out of shape.&#xD;
            I am asking questions to myself. "Is swimming good exercise ?" "How can I make swimming as decent exercise ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
*Last words : Everybody is in pretty good shape in running club. What am I missing ?</content>

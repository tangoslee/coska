Canada's growth rate will be cut in half this year because of troubles in the U.S. economy, the Bank of Nova Scotia says in a report to be released today.&#xD;
&#xD;
The bank predicts growth will fall to 2.1 per cent this year and about 2.9 per cent in 2002, compared with an estimated 4.7 per cent for 2000. The estimate is down from a 3.6 per cent forecast in the bank's last report in November.&#xD;
&#xD;
So far, Canada has escaped the sharp drop in the U.S. economy, posting strong growth in the last half of 2000. But the Canadian economy - especially the troubled manufacturing sector - is now feeling the pain of the U.S. slowdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
``While a big dose of fiscal stimulus and pent-up domestic demand have given our economy a performance edge, roughly half of private sector activity is oriented to global markets that are in the process of gearing down,'' Scotiabank chief economist Warren Jestin said.&#xD;
&#xD;
``As a result, Canadian growth is likely to move down toward 2 per cent this year, the softest performance since 1996.'' &#xD;

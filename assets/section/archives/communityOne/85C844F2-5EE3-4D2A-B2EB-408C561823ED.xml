Greetings,&#xD;
&#xD;
It gives me great pleasure to inform you all that I've coded an applet based Mock Exam for SCEA-J2EE Part 1 and integrated into my website. Please visit http://www.harishramchandani.com &#xD;
&#xD;
FYI, I scored 89% in part 1 and now going for part 2 and final part 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
P.S. Indians can also enjoy Non-Stop Radio of Indian Songs on my website.&#xD;
&#xD;
Thanks,&#xD;
Harish Ramchandani,&#xD;

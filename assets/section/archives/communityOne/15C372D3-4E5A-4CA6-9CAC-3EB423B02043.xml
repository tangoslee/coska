    <content>Thanks for accepting my challenge.&#xD;
Now my next goal is very clear and my journey becomes interesting. I can swim 500 m in 25 minutes. I still have long way to go in order to compete with Spencer.&#xD;
&#xD;
Now I am going to hire my personal swimming trainer, Lee Jun-Ho. &#xD;
&#xD;
I will see Spencer at the pool in a month time.&#xD;
&#xD;
Good Luck to me and Spencer&#xD;
&#xD;
ps: I will buy the lunch before and after race because you give the chance for me to improve and will make my life that much fun for a month.&#xD;

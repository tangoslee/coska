&amp;nbsp;I  stared at it for almost 2 minutes before I figured it out.&#xD;
&#xD;
You  have to get really close to the screen and check the whole thing over!&amp;nbsp;  &#xD;
&#xD;
Hint: Look deeply into the picture on the  wall. It shocked me when I&#xD;
did finally see it.&amp;nbsp;  &#xD;
Give it some time... you'll see it!!!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#xD;
&#xD;
Trust  me....&#xD;

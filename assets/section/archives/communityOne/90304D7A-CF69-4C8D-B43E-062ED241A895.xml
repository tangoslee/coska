    <content>Does anyone work with Webservice development?&#xD;
&#xD;
When we use automation tool such as WSDL2JAVA or JAVA2WSDL through command line or Websphere studio, the tool generates all kind of java classes for conversion between java and XML.&#xD;
Once these classes are generated, any simple change on WSDL file or java class to add some more functionalities require to run the tool from scratch. Even I have a concern of &#xD;
the existing implementation classes might be overriden by that automated class generation when I use WSDL2JAVA approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
I find this quite cumbersome and wonder if this approach of depending on that automated tool makes sense practically in real development field.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'd like to hear your experience with Webservice development - what kind of tools, servers, how to manage this SOAP message and JAVA mapping...&#xD;

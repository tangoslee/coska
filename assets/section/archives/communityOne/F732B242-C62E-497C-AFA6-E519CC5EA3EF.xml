    <content>I've introduced "Being the Best by Denis Waitley" to our members during Soft Skills seminar. I hope that you (will) have the opportunity to read/hear what he has to say/write. You could call this book/audio tape as another motivation things. But to me it was little more than that It was not motivation I found. It provided me a chance to reflect myself and my values. &#xD;
What kind person am I ? &#xD;
What are the my values ? &#xD;
Where is my integrity ?&#xD;
&#xD;
I asked century old questions to myself. It was one of the defining moments of my time. Of course it did not come in first sight or first listening. I listened about 3/4 times first time. And I repeatedly listened a month down the road. Anyway it was time well spent. Now you know how much I liked it.&#xD;
&#xD;
I like to close my article with Quote from the book. Originally it is from Prayer of St. Francis. I did not verify it. But this is how it goes&#xD;
&#xD;
"Change what you can. Accept what you can't change. Ask for wisdom to tell what they are"&#xD;
&#xD;
My translation:&#xD;
In order to change - we need "knowledge" and "courage"&#xD;
On the contrary Accept - it requires "understanding" and "graciousness"&#xD;
Having wisdom - Continuous learning "attitude" and "honesty"&#xD;
Overall - Do the change, accept and think process regular bases&#xD;
&#xD;
My take : "Please allow me to have consistent will to perform above three steps process "Change, Accept, Ask Wisdom"&#xD;
&#xD;
Your take could be different from mine. We are all different somewhat. But what we like to archive is the same. Our ultimate goal is success in personal and professinal life, isn't it ?&#xD;

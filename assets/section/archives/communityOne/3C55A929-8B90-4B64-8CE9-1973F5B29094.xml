    <content>I hope all is well with you since last we spoke. I have a client that is looking for a developer (can be .net or java or anything they have proprietary software there) ideally around the 70K mark for base salary, can start immediately and they need the proponent to have P&amp;C insurance experience. If you can refer anyone on I’ll be most appreciative. Location is Toronto, Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
I’ll continue to keep my eyes out for other roles for you as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
Cheers,&#xD;

    <content>After presentation most of time I received mixed feeling. They are "It is over", "next time I can do it better", "I could do better preparation". Specially this time I had more mixed feeling. Because I tried something new. I had three phases presentation. &#xD;
&#xD;
First was "How to Run" - introduce running exercise to nonrunners who like to try but do not know where to begin. Also I like to emphasis mental benefit sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
Secondly I like to analysis interpersonal skill using 10 class sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
Lastly include our children into the the equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Attempt was very encouraging. However I could organize it better. My presentation contained a lot of info in short time. I apologize of inconvience and I do it better next time.&#xD;
&#xD;
Meanwhile please post your feedback for my personal improvement&#xD;

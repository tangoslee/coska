    <content>Is anybody interested in SCBCD?&#xD;
I am preparing the certification and I would like to invite small group for this.&#xD;
I believe several person preparing together is more efficient than one person do.&#xD;
Shard each idea, mock questions and cheers up each other.&#xD;
Please, let me know who are interested in my suggestion.&#xD;

    <content>I totally agree with Scott's opinion.&#xD;
I was thinking about the format of the English Session&#xD;
&#xD;
My Idea&#xD;
- Just like Scott suggested presenter will prepare and present in English&#xD;
- Q &amp; A will be communicate in both English and Korean in order to maximize participation&#xD;
- We need honest feedback to presenter and also participants at the end of session&#xD;
- To increase effectiveness and minimum effort presentation materials should be prepared and published a week in advance&#xD;
- About our mind set prior to External Guest&#xD;
  We should be physically and mentally ready. We should present ourselves as IT professionals. We should be ready to examine external guest speakers thoroughly. We need to make the statement to the guests that it is not another day at the office. It is real deal.&#xD;
&#xD;
ps : I like to ask to each member. "Are you ready ?"&#xD;
"Are you ready for new challenges ? " Are you ready to test yourselves collectively ?"&#xD;
Comm1 : I am waiting for your answers.</content>

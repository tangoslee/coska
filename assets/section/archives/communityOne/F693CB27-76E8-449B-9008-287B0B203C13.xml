    <content>I had been running for last few months. I am going to participate my first competitive running on Dec. 1st for 10 km. I am running almost everyday in the morning. Funny thing is my left shoulder hurt most while I am running. Not my leg, not my foot, not my lung, but my left shoulder. My weakest part of body is my left shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
Let me ask you a question about China’s Great Walls : Did it do the job as what ancient Chinese expected ?&#xD;
My estimation it did not. Then why ?&#xD;
My interpretation : Even though Chinese spent tons of fortune and toil. Once small part of wall is penetrated by the enemies. This wall was no good. Once enemies passed the  barrier it was over.&#xD;
&#xD;
What did we learn for this dilemma ?&#xD;
We should think about our weakest link not our strongest link.&#xD;
Let say I am very good at everything except interpersonal skill. I am not welcome anywhere due to my flaw. It could be very small flaw compare to my all the merits. But people have tendency to look for other person’s flaw not the merits. Person with less qualifications but overall better person will succeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
Let’s improve our strength but spare the time to reflect our flaws. When we know our flaws we can prepare our worst fear.&#xD;

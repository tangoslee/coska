    <content>I loaded zip file of design pattern e-book on &#xD;
our FTP server.&#xD;
&#xD;
1. after accessing our FTP server..&#xD;
(Please refer how to access it written by Mr.Choi&#xD;
Ik Jun..)&#xD;
go to /okid subdirectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. get the only zip file.&#xD;
&#xD;
That book doesn't include java sample code, but&#xD;
it is really well described easily , worth of trying.&#xD;
&#xD;

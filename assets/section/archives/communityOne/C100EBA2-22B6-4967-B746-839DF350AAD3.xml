    <content>Hi Travis, I'm sending this email because we have recently aquired a new client,&#xD;
J.P. Morgan Chase, a global financial powerhouse that operates out of 50&#xD;
countries. They have moved their IT Development to Houston, Texas. As a result&#xD;
of expansion they are looking for a number of FULLTIME Application Developers&#xD;
with strong server side C++ or Java experience with current or prior experience&#xD;
in OOA/OOD, UML and RDBMS. These positions would be located in Houston, Texas.&#xD;
In order to qualify you must have 5-10 years of experience, a 3yr Degree or a&#xD;
2yr Diploma with 3yrs Canadian work experience and be a Canadian or U.S.&#xD;
Citizen. This is an exciting opportunity for someone who is open to relocating&#xD;
to Houston. The salary's are very competitive and all come with a signing Bonus&#xD;
and relocation assistance. The tax rates are much lower than here and the&#xD;
average Temperature is much higher. A complete benefit package is provided as&#xD;
well.If you have an interest or know of anyone that wants to relocate, please&#xD;
contact me so we can discuss this further. I should mention that they may&#xD;
consider contractors but have a strong preference for FULLTIME people.&#xD;
Thanks Tim&#xD;

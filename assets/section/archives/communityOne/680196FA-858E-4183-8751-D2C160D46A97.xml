    <content>- Single or Group Sport&#xD;
  There are choices. Sometimes sex could be single sport but that is the topic for another day&#xD;
- Do not need consent from your partner&#xD;
  You could ride bike anytime you desires&#xD;
- Outdoor sport.&#xD;
  It is good for your health. Fresh air&#xD;
- No cost &#xD;
  If one owns a bicycle, it is free&#xD;
- Could enjoy as long as one wants&#xD;
  I can't say same thing about other sport&#xD;
- Could meet new people or could change partners easily&#xD;
  In order to change partner for other sport is not simple&#xD;
- Don't need to be naked&#xD;
  Optional&#xD;
- When other people find out while you are doing it, it is not embarrassing. Matter of facts you could be proud of what you are doing &#xD;
  Other sport ???&#xD;
- Could be Family thing&#xD;
  Family thing could be very good activity.&#xD;
  Other sport : too embarrassing to discuss&#xD;
- Don't need to be 18 or older to do it</content>

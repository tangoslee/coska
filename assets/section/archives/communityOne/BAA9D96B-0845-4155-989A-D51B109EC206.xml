    <content>I am glad I am a member of comm1. I get so much out of this community. Not only I am technically educated also I get the information of what is going on in the market. Personally I have some outside contacts such as my peers, my former co-workers and school friends. New comers could take full advantage of Comm1. Instead of contacts left behind in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
I can't thank enough all the hard work put on forming Comm1 community by each member. In order to go further with Comm1, Comm1 needs as much as inputs and feedbacks from each member possible. If you have any ideas, please post your ideas. You never know what kind positive impacts your ideas could bring. There is all saying in English "One man's junk could be other men's treasure". &#xD;

I like what Scott Lee did. Post his idea on BBS. If nobody is interested in, That's OK too. Maybe it is the time yet. However other members have the similar ideas. We could go ahead with the new ideas after group discussion. One person does not own Comm1. It is owned by all of us. What a great concept ! Sky is the limit. We have very good foundation potentially. It is up to us to make it happen.&#xD;
&#xD;
Once again I am proud of a member of Comm1. Thanks for you patience that read the article to the end.&#xD;

    <content>"Hi, honey, this is Daddy," .... &#xD;
"Is your Mommy near the phone?"&#xD;
  &#xD;
"No, Daddy. She's upstairs in the bedroom with Uncle Frank,"&#xD;
  &#xD;
After a brief pause, Daddy says, "But you haven't got an Uncle Frank, honey!"&#xD;
  &#xD;
"Oh Yes, I do, and he's upstairs in the bedroom with Mommy, right now!"&#xD;
  &#xD;
"Uh, Okay, then......here's what I want you do. Put down the phone, run upstairs and knock on the bedroom door and shout to Mommy and Uncle Frank that Daddy's car's just pulled up outside the house."&#xD;
  &#xD;
"Okay, Daddy!"&#xD;
  &#xD;
A few minutes later, the little girl comes back to the phone.  "Well, I did what you said, Daddy."&#xD;
  &#xD;
"And what happened?" he asks.&#xD;
  &#xD;
"Well, Mommy got all scared, jumped out of bed with no clothes on and ran around screaming, then she tripped over the rug and went flying through the front window ...and now she's all dead."&#xD;
  &#xD;
"Oh my God!!!!! And what about Uncle Frank?"&#xD;
  &#xD;
"He jumped out of bed with no clothes on too and he was all scared and he jumped out the back window into the Swimming pool..... but he must have forgot that last week you took out all the water to clean it, so he hit the bottom of the swimming pool and now he's all real dead too."&#xD;
  &#xD;

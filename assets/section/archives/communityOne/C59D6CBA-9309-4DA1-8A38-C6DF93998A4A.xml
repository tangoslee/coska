    <content>I am in transition of my dev environment of Eclipse + Tomcat to WebSphere studio and server and have quite a bit of issues now.&#xD;
&#xD;
Where does WebSphere store its loggging in case some "unexpected" exceptions happens within the deployed application?&#xD;
&#xD;
WebSphere has its own log directory and some kind of &#xD;
file named as "...exception" seems to be the file keeping &#xD;
all kinds of errors that hadn't been caught by the application itself.&#xD;
But I cannot find any exception stack information or anything.&#xD;
Every exceptions I saw on that file was all IBM's own exceptions not my application.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tomcat catches these unexpected errors and put them on&#xD;
its own log file so it is quite good spot to get a clue of&#xD;
what went wrong.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'd like to find a similar log file in WebSphere but so far no luck..&#xD;

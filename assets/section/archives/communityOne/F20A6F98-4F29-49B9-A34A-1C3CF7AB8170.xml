    <content>Hi Comm-oners&#xD;
&#xD;
I have been working as a volunteer of Mississauga Centural Library for 3 months now. I was trying to get book donation without the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
- I tried Churchs first no luck because they have their own library&#xD;
- Contact Korean Newpapers no lucks&#xD;
  Korea Times : not enough personnel to manage&#xD;
  Jung Ang    : told me that potential 2000 books but didn't work out. no new books&#xD;
&#xD;
I need you help. Please let me know if you have the books you like to share with others</content>

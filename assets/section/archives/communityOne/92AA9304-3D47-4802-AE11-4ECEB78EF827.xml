    <content>An elderly married couple scheduled their medical examination on the same day so that they could answer any questions the doctor might have concerning their partner. &#xD;
&#xD;
After the husband's exam, the doctor then said to the elderly man, "You appear to be in good health. Do you have any medical concerns that you would like to ask me?" &#xD;
     &#xD;
"In fact, I do," said the old man. "After I have sex with my wife the first time, I am usually hot and sweaty, and then, after I have sex with my wife the second time, I'm usually cold and chilly." &#xD;
     &#xD;
The doctor said that he would examine the wife, and then report back to the man.   After examining the elderly lady, the doctor said: &#xD;
"Everything appears to be fine. Do you have any medical concerns that you would like to discuss with me?" &#xD;
     &#xD;
The lady replied that she had no questions or concerns. &#xD;
     &#xD;
The doctor then asked: "Your husband had an unusual concern. He claims that he is usually hot and sweaty after having sex the first time with you, and then cold and chilly after the second time. Do you know why?" &#xD;
     &#xD;
"Oh that crazy old nut", she replied. "That's because the first time is usually in July and the second time is usually in December!" &#xD;

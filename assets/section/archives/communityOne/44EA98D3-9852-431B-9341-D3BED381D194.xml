    <content>I implemented uploading files using oreilly's multiparti filter classes already. This has been working perfect with Tomcat for the last 2 years, and seems *conditionally* OK with WebSphere 5.0 though Websphere has a problem of loosing request object's parameters in forwarded JSP.&#xD;
I spent quite a time to track down what happened with Webspere but this was not my question.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The question is not how to implement uploading files but&#xD;
how to set up "virtual path" concept that maps specific URL into physical file system's directoy, which is not located within the application's deployment directory.&#xD;
&#xD;

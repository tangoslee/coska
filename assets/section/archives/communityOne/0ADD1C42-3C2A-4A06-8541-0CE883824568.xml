    <content>More than 210 customers in the Americas, Asia/Pacific, and Europe selected BEA over IBM in head-to-head sales situations during the past quarter, says BEA. In 125 of these cases, BEA was selected despite the fact that IBM WebSphere was the incumbent platform. This includes 94 instances in which WebSphere customers selected BEA for new projects, and 31 scenarios in which IBM WebSphere was removed and replaced with BEA WebLogicTM. &#xD;
&#xD;
The victories for BEA cut across geography, market sector, and project size, with sales ranging from under $100,000 to more than $10 million. Customers consistently cited the BEA WebLogic Platform's unified, simplified, and extensible enterprise architecture as a deciding factor. The BEA platform supports applications as diverse as information portals and mission-critical commerce engines that handle millions of transactions per day. Customers were impressed by BEA's ability to provide a multitude of credible references: real-world BEA users who could discuss the substantive business benefits of BEA WebLogic as well as the platform's remarkable ease of use. &#xD;
&#xD;
Another point of differentiation between BEA and the competition is the notion of "serviceware." Customers who have purchased from other vendors, including IBM, have been frustrated by the time-consuming and extremely expensive consulting services often required to get applications up and running. Some vendors even offer their software for free, or at greatly reduced prices, to entice customers, only to end up charging far more than BEA in the long run due to the high cost of their services. &#xD;

&#xD;
Still another key point of differentiation for BEA is standards support, which customers view as a critical investment in protection against obsolescence and a strong indicator of a vendor's commitment to providing an open, flexible platform. &#xD;
&#xD;
Among the 200 companies that recently selected BEA over IBM are: Abt Electronics, China Mobile, China Telecom, Edmunds, Federal Portal Belgium, Finnish Railways, JD Edwards, Karjaportti, Kookmin Bank, Lufthansa Technik, Magax, MyDoc.com, Shanghai Finance Bureau, Silicon Graphics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, TIM Wireless of Peru, and Vodafone. &#xD;

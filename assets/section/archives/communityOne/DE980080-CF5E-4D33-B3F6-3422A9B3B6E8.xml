    <content>1. Write down 3 most important things for you in 30 sec.&#xD;
    We make the best decision during crunch time. These three things do not pop up in 30 sec. They are stored in our unconscious mind. If any one of us spends more than 30 sec, it could not be accurate. Because they are from conscious side not from unconscious&#xD;
 &#xD;
 2. If you win a million dollars, what you do ?&#xD;
    Be prepared. We would not have enough time to decide when it happens. I have seen many time a lot of Korean convenient stores sold their business due to many different reasons but they get back into the same business after a few months. Create a detail plan. It will happen if you believe in it. And you will have fun doing it.&#xD;
&#xD;
 3. If there are no constraints such as money, time, ethic, what do you want to do ?&#xD;
     Nike commercial : Just do it. However it is what one likes to do rest of one's life. Things can bring one fulfillment of life. &#xD;
&#xD;
 4. If you have 2 months to live, how do you spend your remaining ?&#xD;
     Many famous philosophers said, "Live today like it's one's last day of life". There are no guarantees in life. One should enjoy/live/deliver like there are no tomorrow literally.&#xD;

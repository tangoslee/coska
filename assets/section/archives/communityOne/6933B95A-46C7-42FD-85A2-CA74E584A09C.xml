            <content>비슷한 경우 인거 같은데 혹시 못보셨다면 참고하세요. 여기 이야기로는 mustunderstand tag때문에 생기는 문젠데 .Net인 경우 mustunderstand tag가 default로 true가 되는데 WebSphere에서는 컨트롤 할 수 없다는....-_-;; 그래서 코드에서 고쳐주면 되는데 단 WSE 2.0을 써야 한다네요. http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.dotnet.framework.webservices.enhancements/browse_frm/thread/b21af082ef686c8f/a080e8c7cad8740f?q=%22SOAP+body+is+not+signed%22&amp;_done=%2Fgroups%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3D%22SOAP+body+is+not+signed%22%26&amp;_doneTitle=Back+to+Search&amp;&amp;d#a080e8c7cad8740f&#xD;

    <content>Thank you for the reply.&#xD;

I compared the SOAP messages between the one generated by java client and the other one from .Net client.&#xD;
&#xD;
The SOAP message coming from .Net client holds the same structure and the same value of the client certificate in encoded way(Base64).&#xD;
&#xD;
Most of SOAP message structures are almost same between java and .Net client&#xD;
except a few things related to xml naming space definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
The trouble in testing WebService is the error messages from WebSphere is just too simple - "The body of Soap is not signed" but I bet there are many various reasons for this simple error.&#xD;
&#xD;
- The server cannot recognize tags related to the digital sign data from .Net&#xD;
- The server cannot identify the reference of the SOAP body so cannot find where to pick up the signature and digest value of the SOAP body.&#xD;
- Simple the server has a bug with WS-Security Interoperability - I am testing this on WebSphere Studio test environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
I expect if this problem is related to something wrong with certificate, WebSphere should spit out more specific message such as "unknown certificate", "cannot find a certificate or public key of the requested digital sign".&#xD;
&#xD;
I am trying in some different way of sending the message out now.&#xD;

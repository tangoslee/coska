I fixed this power button problem by reinstalling Win2000 as clean installation. First time, I selected 'upgrade' option. But it ended up with desktop starting problem. So I chose 'clean installation' ,. Then it works fine. Then another problem is my sound card, display setting. I am going to re-install all device software. </content>

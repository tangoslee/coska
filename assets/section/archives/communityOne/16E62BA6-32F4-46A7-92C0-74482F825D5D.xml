    <content>Some checkpoints for you.&#xD;
&#xD;
(1) Make sure the query name is globally unique in all cases&#xD;
&#xD;
(2) Defined the query name 'test2', but you tried 'test1'&#xD;
&#xD;
(3) I've not seen any example mixing two different ways of variable set using '?' and ':&lt;variable_name&gt;'. You could choose one of them =&gt; I was wrong. '?' is for output parameter that's used only for Oracle driver. If not, 'call' in the query itself returns a value if your stored procedure returns anything. So, for input parameter, you have to use ':&lt;param&gt;'&#xD;
&#xD;
(4) I cannot check the Hibernate source code now for setParameter(int, Object) because I don't recall if it starts with 1 for the first variable index. If you're not sure of it, I suggest to use named variable than a question mark.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
(5) For JPA, the stored procedure query needs to be in {} but I believe you don't use JPA.</content>

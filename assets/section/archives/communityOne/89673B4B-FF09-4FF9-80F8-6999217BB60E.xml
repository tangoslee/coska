    <content>Hi Mr. Chairman…&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Chairman please forgives of my bad behaviors from the last night. I am very sure you will demonstrate how this kind of things gets done. I know you have the big plan for you personally. But why don’t you do it your way not like Spence nor Steve. Be yourself. If you want to do the seminar every day for instance, convince others. If you can come to seminar each time, do it differently your way. Unique way of Andrew Shin’s.&#xD;
&#xD;
Let me share the quote from “Attitude is everything”&#xD;
“life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we respond to it” &#xD;
&#xD;
You will be fine. You have done it your way so far. You made it this far. You will make it to the end. We will support you and serve you. Mr. Chairman.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Sincerely Yours&#xD;
&#xD;
A humble member &#xD;

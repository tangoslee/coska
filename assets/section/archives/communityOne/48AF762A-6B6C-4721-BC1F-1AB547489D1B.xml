English teacher locates venues for talented students &#xD;
Kristin Rushowy&#xD;
EDUCATION REPORTER &#xD;
They're artistic masters who are also trying to master the English language.&#xD;
&#xD;
Broken English Artists, a group of six immigrants, came together after one approached English-as-a-second-language teacher Barb Rosen last September, seeking help to exhibit her paintings.&#xD;
&#xD;
From there, Rosen took five others under her wing, including a classical singer, a paper-folding artist and an egg artist, and helped them find venues for their work.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ukrainian oboeist Georgiy Kastulin performed for shoppers at IKEA stores during the Christmas holidays; classical singer Cathy Kim, of South Korea, has given two concerts, at an Indigo bookstore and a church.&#xD;
&#xD;
The artists also demonstrate their craft for others in their English classes and are hosting a March break arts camp for kids next week.&#xD;
&#xD;
``Many have lost their self-esteem and confidence - they don't know the language and feel they've lost part of their identity,'' Rosen said.&#xD;
&#xD;
``When you come and do something in a new country, you feel good about it.''&#xD;
&#xD;
Egg artist Anna Lee, who came to Canada in 1999, majored in crafts at university in South Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
She turns chicken, emu, goose and duck eggs into decorative jewelry boxes, figurines and even picture frames. &#xD;
&#xD;
Her work is on display at the Toronto Reference Library until April 12. &#xD;

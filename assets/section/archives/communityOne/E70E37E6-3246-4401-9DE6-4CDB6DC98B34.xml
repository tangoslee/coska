    <content>you could try &#xD;
1. use ping command to ping some certain IP address in dos command prompt, e.g. ping 211.116.231.19 &#xD;
2. use "arp -a" command to get the MAC address of the above host &#xD;
&#xD;
otherwise, You'll have to use a native interface and a 'C' program to get the MAC address. &#xD;

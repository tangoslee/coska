    <content>A man was driving home one evening and realized that it was his daughter's birthday and he hadn't bought her a present. He drove to the mall and ran to the toy store and he asked the store manager "How much is that new Barbie in the window?"&#xD;
&#xD;
The Manager replied, "Which one? We have 'Barbie goes to the gym' for $19.95.. 'Barbie goes to the Ball' for $19.95 ... 'Barbie goes shopping for $19.95 ...'Barbie goes to the beach' for $19.95 ... 'Barbie goes to the Nightclub' for $19.95.. and 'Divorced Barbie' for $375.00".&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why is the Divorced Barbie $375.00, when all the others are $19.95?" Dad asked surprised.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Divorced Barbie comes with Ken's car, Ken's House, Ken's boat, Ken's dog, Ken's cat and Ken's furniture."&#xD;

    <content>I am not sure if any one interested in Halifax opportunity. If you are, then mail to me. I can forward it to this &#xD;
agent. &#xD;
&#xD;
Good thing is Halifax living cost is half of Toronto. You can save a lot and weather is milder than here. &#xD;
(ps: don't contact her directly at first time. They will not show interest to you then)&#xD;
&#xD;
FYI (For your information) -----------------&#xD;

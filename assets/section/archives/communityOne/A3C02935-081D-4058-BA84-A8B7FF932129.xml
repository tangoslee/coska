            <content>Global IME는 win95/98/NT4.0만 지원한다고 되어 있네요. 혹시 모르니... 제어판의 '국가별설정'을 시도해 보시는 건 어떨까요?</content>

    <content>I recently installed Windows 2000 on my computer at work.&#xD;
Since then, I can not write in Korean although there is no problem reading Korean.&#xD;
&#xD;
I used to use MS Global IME on Win NT.&#xD;
But I cannot install the software on Win2K.&#xD;
It says... "Thie version of Global IME cannot be installed on this version of Windows".&#xD;
&#xD;
So, I checked MS download site and found newest one "Global IME for Office XP".&#xD;
But then, this one requires "Office XP" which I don't have.&#xD;
&#xD;
Does anyone know how to write Korean on Win2K?&#xD;
What software do I need to install?&#xD;
&#xD;
Thanks!&#xD;

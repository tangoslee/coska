    <content>Hi James,&#xD;
I work with the Keith Bagg Group as a Consultant. You had submitted your&#xD;
resume to us in the past. I understand that you are currently involved in an&#xD;
assignment. I have a contract available which is a 3 to 6 month to start&#xD;
with a likelihood of going to 1 year. My client is looking for a Java GUI&#xD;
Developer. Could you perhaps recommend any friends or colleagues who have&#xD;
experience with the items below? Any help is appreciated.&#xD;

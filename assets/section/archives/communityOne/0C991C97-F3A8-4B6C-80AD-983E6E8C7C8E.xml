    <content>Hi Spencer, formerly known as Mr. Chairman…..&#xD;
&#xD;
What can I say !  It was such a fine job you have given us for one full year. You set the good example. I am sure Andrew will do dandy performance as new chairman. I am sure you will contribute to Comm. One as a different role, a Webmaster.&#xD;
&#xD;
Without your Comm. One website I can’t image where we could be now. You have already done a lot to Comm. One yet I have few favors to ask.&#xD;
&#xD;
Scott started it. We know how to get it done. I mean the writing the book. I like to start very simple. If only and if we, Comm. One, can write the book about creation, progress, and weekly or month growth of Comm. One. It could provide the good insight to other existing groups or to form a new group. Like I was saying “Comm. One is not static on contrary it is organic”. They have the huge difference. Static group only can grow upto the limit set in the initial goal. But Organic group will grow if there are people could feed the knowledge without the limit.” The book could be good insight for people in Canada and also to new IT immigrants from our homeland.&#xD;
&#xD;
Other one is you have the talent to become good translator. Why don’t you challenge yourself. I can feel you have the talent and will.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Sincerely Yours&#xD;

    <content>My Interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
Current Stage&#xD;
============&#xD;
- Technical Info sharing&#xD;
- Friendly association&#xD;
- no more new members joining in&#xD;
- running out of seminar topics&#xD;
- not bad still very good&#xD;
&#xD;
Different Options&#xD;
===============&#xD;
- Stay as we are : not bad and comfortable&#xD;
- Convert to revenue generation group&#xD;
   getting external project as a group&#xD;
   or create own projects and sell&#xD;
- Community volunteer works&#xD;
   Korean Society : there are others&#xD;
   mainstream : different experience&#xD;
&#xD;
Transform to become volunteer group&#xD;
==================================&#xD;
- more spouses and children participation&#xD;
- satisfying experience specially for children&#xD;
- more involvement into mainstream&#xD;
&#xD;
Transform to become project based group&#xD;
======================================&#xD;
Pros&#xD;
- good experience : find out what we are made of&#xD;
- good stepping stone for next ...&#xD;
- could be extra income&#xD;
- excitement&#xD;
&#xD;
Cons&#xD;
- initial investment : time and money&#xD;
- who's going to be the leaders&#xD;
- we could lose what we have currently totally&#xD;
&#xD;
Questions&#xD;
=========&#xD;
- Are we ready to transform ?&#xD;
- if not, what should we do ?&#xD;
- Do you like where things are ?&#xD;
- Are we on up or down path ?&#xD;
- Do we need new young blood in the system ?&#xD;

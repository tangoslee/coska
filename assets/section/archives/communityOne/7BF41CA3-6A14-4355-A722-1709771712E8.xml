    <content>I want to shed a different light on Java and .NET world.&#xD;
&#xD;
First of all, technologies take time to mature.&#xD;
When java came to world, it was very slow and not many API, tools and frameworks were there.&#xD;
Maybe MS can make it faster, but still needs time.&#xD;
&#xD;
Second, it needs people to be used widely - programmers, sales forces and especially architects. Deploying in enterprise environment is different from being chosen by consumers.&#xD;
Architects have great power to draw bigger architecture. So architects are opinion leaders and consumers of enterprise platforms.&#xD;
how many architects feel comfortable with MS technologies.&#xD;
Few years ago, it was easy to find architects come from C/Unix world. &#xD;
Now there are architects who have real good background with OOP, java.&#xD;
How long will it take to see architects with .NET technology?&#xD;
&#xD;
16 years ago, When I started working in IT industry, I developed SNA/BSC 3270 emulator running on Unix servers. At that time, unix machines were used largely replacing expensive IBM terminals.&#xD;
It wasn't long ago when Unix servers are used as enterprise servers.&#xD;
How long will it take to see Windows(.NET) servers take place as enterprise servers?&#xD;
Actually Windows started deploying as departmental servers and entry level enterprise servers. But it seems to me that the change is stalled by linux.(All of sudden, SCO tries to stall linux by sueing IBM and linux backers. MS makes SCO shake IBM and other linux backers by licensing from SCO)&#xD;
&#xD;
let's see what happens next!!!</content>

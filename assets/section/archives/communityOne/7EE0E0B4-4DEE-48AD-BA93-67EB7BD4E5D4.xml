    <content>It is not enough to just say "I understand" or "I appreciate how you feel."  Those words are just words-and they aren't always believed.  To be believed, you must prove that you take someone's views seriously.  This requires using the same energy and emotion to "connect" with that person's level on the Decision Ladder!  After all, that is how we do it with friends when we really care.&#xD;

    <content>This is Mr. 'BITTER'. :)&#xD;
&#xD;
It was a BIG surprise that I found out somebody spread and posted a resume sample/template that's originated and modified slightly from my resume.&#xD;
&#xD;
So, taking advantage of this incident, I'd like to pinpoint something today.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sometimes we send/receive resumes for certain purposes. One instance is about looking for help on job search. In that case, we use the resume only to forward to someone who actually needs to review it.&#xD;
&#xD;
However, I'm afraid to say there're people 'still' using it for other personal purposes. For example, they give it to someone else who just wants some samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
Let's remember it is not my beloning and I have to let the owner know if I need to share it for any reason. Even each has his/her own private information. &#xD;
&#xD;
So, please consider this as a serious matter. I hope we all keep such a basic courtesy and etiquette.&#xD;
&#xD;
Thanks for reading.</content>

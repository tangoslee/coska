            <content>What I've seen is it appends jsessionid to the url for the first page. After that it doesn't append anything.</content>

    <content>Our application does not use cookie for session tracking, &#xD;
so had to turn off cookie mode for session in Tomcat3.&#xD;
Now, the app is moved up to tomcat 4, with different format of server.xml, which does not provide the tag for the user to turn off cookies.&#xD;
&#xD;
What I am not sure is Tomcat 4's default session tracking is based on URL rewritting or still cookie?&#xD;
&#xD;
Anyone has this sort of issue with tomcat 4?&#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you!&#xD;

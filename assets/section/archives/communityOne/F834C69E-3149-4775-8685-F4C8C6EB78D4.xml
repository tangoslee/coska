    <content>Hi everybody. I have suggestion to have series of workshop.&#xD;
It has been 19 years since I had graduated from the school.&#xD;
When I was in school, I was busy studying (????) plus I had a lot of discussion among friends about future, life, sex, friendship, money and etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since then I have been busy surviving not living. I will reassess my life, goal and age old questions during holiday season. I will be home most of time due to new born.&#xD;
&#xD;
If there are enough persons to reassess the similar interests, I like to have the opportunity to discuss in coming year.&#xD;
&#xD;
Agenda&#xD;
=======&#xD;
- What is the life and what is the meaning of life in lighter side ?&#xD;
- How to raise our kids ?&#xD;
- Marriage : What the heck is it ?&#xD;
- Future of Community one &#xD;
- What are we doing here in Canada ?&#xD;
- Career advancement &#xD;
&#xD;
I know every single one of them is very heavy subjects itself. However I like to discuss in lighter side.&#xD;
&#xD;
Initially I like to discuss "WHAT and "WHY".&#xD;
There will be chance to discuss "HOW" latter days.&#xD;
&#xD;
If you like the concept, please put your name down at below.&#xD;
Format could be one topic for one session and roundtable. Participants will have time limit to speak. Thus eveybody can participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
Names&#xD;
======&#xD;
Thomas Lee&#xD;
Scott  Lee&#xD;
Spencer Hwang&#xD;

    <content>I'm really flatterred!&#xD;
Actually, I appreciate the feedback from ThomasLee&#xD;
like "I said 'Actually' too much"&#xD;
or "I'd better use 'we' instead of 'you'...."&#xD;
&#xD;
Is it like picking up watermelon?  huh?&#xD;
Actually,(hmm.... actually?)&#xD;
Several years ago, I was picking up watermelon.&#xD;
One watermelon looked very good. But I decided to&#xD;
find another one hoping to get the better one&#xD;
and asked around.&#xD;
After a while, I thought that first watermelon was better than others, when I got back to pick up the first one, I found that all the watermelon sold out..&#xD;
~~For heaven's sake...&#xD;
~~What the...&#xD;
~~Son ofa..&#xD;
~~How the...&#xD;
&#xD;
So I had to wait for another year.&#xD;
The next year, I made up my mind to pick up any decent one if I have a chance.&#xD;
But this time, they were asking too much for that watermelon. I was not able to afford to take it.&#xD;
So I couldn't help but waiting for another year &amp; year &amp; years....&#xD;
HEW~~~~~&#xD;
Now the problem is that watermelon is out of season,&#xD;
so it's very hard to get a new one.&#xD;
If worst comes worst,I'm not going to get the used one. &#xD;
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...&#xD;
Is there any good watermelon around here by chance?&#xD;
even in our Home country?&#xD;

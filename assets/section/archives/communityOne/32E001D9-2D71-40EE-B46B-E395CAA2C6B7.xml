If programming languages were religions...&#xD;
By amz at 14:52&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
C would be Judaism - it's old and restrictive, but most of the world&#xD;
is familiar with its laws and respects them. The catch is, you can't&#xD;
convert into it - you're either into it from the start, or you will&#xD;
think that it's insanity. Also, when things go wrong, many people are&#xD;
willing to blame the problems of the world on it.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
Java would be Fundamentalist Christianity - it's theoretically based&#xD;
on C, but it voids so many of the old laws that it doesn't feel like&#xD;
the original at all. Instead, it adds its own set of rigid rules,&#xD;
which its followers believe to be far superior to the original. Not&#xD;
only are they certain that it's the best language in the world, but&#xD;
they're willing to burn those who disagree at the stake.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
PHP would be Cafeteria Christianity - Fights with Java for the web&#xD;
market. It draws a few concepts from C and Java, but only those that&#xD;
it really likes. Maybe it's not as coherent as other languages, but at&#xD;
least it leaves you with much more freedom and ostensibly keeps the&#xD;
core idea of the whole thing. Also, the whole concept of "goto hell"&#xD;
was abandoned.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
C++ would be Islam - It takes C and not only keeps all its laws, but&#xD;
adds a very complex new set of laws on top of it. It's so versatile&#xD;
that it can be used to be the foundation of anything, from great&#xD;
atrocities to beautiful works of art. Its followers are convinced that&#xD;
it is the ultimate universal language, and may be angered by those who&#xD;
disagree. Also, if you insult it or its founder, you'll probably be&#xD;
threatened with death by more radical followers.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
C# would be Mormonism - At first glance, it's the same as Java, but at&#xD;
a closer look you realize that it's controlled by a single corporation&#xD;
(which many Java followers believe to be evil), and that many&#xD;
theological concepts are quite different. You suspect that it'd&#xD;
probably be nice, if only all the followers of Java wouldn't&#xD;
discriminate so much against you for following it.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
Lisp would be Zen Buddhism - There is no syntax, there is no&#xD;
centralization of dogma, there are no deities to worship. The entire&#xD;
universe is there at your reach - if only you are enlightened enough&#xD;
to grasp it. Some say that it's not a language at all; others say that&#xD;
it's the only language that makes sense.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
Haskell would be Taoism - It is so different from other languages that&#xD;
many people don't understand how can anyone use it to produce anything&#xD;
useful. Its followers believe that it's the true path to wisdom, but&#xD;
that wisdom is beyond the grasp of most mortals.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
Erlang would be Hinduism - It's another strange language that doesn't&#xD;
look like it could be used for anything, but unlike most other modern&#xD;
languages, it's built around the concept of multiple simultaneous&#xD;
deities.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
Perl would be Voodoo - An incomprehensible series of arcane&#xD;
incantations that involve the blood of goats and permanently corrupt&#xD;
your soul. Often used when your boss requires you to do an urgent task&#xD;
at 21:00 on friday night.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
Lua would be Wicca - A pantheistic language that can easily be adapted&#xD;
for different cultures and locations. Its code is very liberal, and&#xD;
allows for the use of techniques that might be described as magical by&#xD;
those used to more traditional languages. It has a strong connection&#xD;
to the moon.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
Ruby would be Neo-Paganism - A mixture of different languages and&#xD;
ideas that was beaten together into something that might be identified&#xD;
as a language. Its adherents are growing fast, and although most&#xD;
people look at them suspiciously, they are mostly well-meaning people&#xD;
with no intention of harming anyone.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
Python would be Humanism: It's simple, unrestrictive, and all you need&#xD;
to follow it is common sense. Many of the followers claim to feel&#xD;
relieved from all the burden imposed by other languages, and that they&#xD;
have rediscovered the joy of programming. There are some who say that&#xD;
it is a form of pseudo-code.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
COBOL would be Ancient Paganism - There was once a time when it ruled&#xD;
over a vast region and was important, but nowadays it's almost dead,&#xD;
for the good of us all. Although many were scarred by the rituals&#xD;
demanded by its deities, there are some who insist on keeping it alive&#xD;
even today.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
APL would be Scientology - There are many people who claim to follow&#xD;
it, but you've always suspected that it's a huge and elaborate prank&#xD;
that got out of control.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
LOLCODE would be Pastafarianism - An esoteric, Internet-born belief&#xD;
that nobody really takes seriously, despite all the efforts to develop&#xD;
and spread it.&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
Visual Basic would be Satanism - Except that you don't REALLY need to&#xD;
sell your soul to be a Satanist...&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
Thanks to jfs and other people on #aegisub for the suggestions. Keep&#xD;
in mind, this list is a joke, and is not meant to offend anyone. Also,&#xD;
if you're a Muslim, please don't kill me. ;)</content>

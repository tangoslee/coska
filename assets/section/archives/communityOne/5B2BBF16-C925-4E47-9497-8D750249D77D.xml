    <content>Hi all.&#xD;
&#xD;
As some of you know already, I'm doing my best to realize my dreams. But only one thing is lacked... yes money! ^^;&#xD;
&#xD;
Currently, I'm in between jobs and I train myself systematically these days. Wow I didn't know that searching jobs is the most tough &amp; difficult work. (at least for me) This is not because there're not many positions out there,&#xD;
&#xD;
So, if you hear anything or know anyone that is related to 'Java developer-like' openings, please don't hesitate to let me know or require me to send my resume. I'd be pleased to be helped.&#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you and have a wonderful life!&#xD;
&#xD;
P.S. I will delete this when I am sure I have a new opp.</content>

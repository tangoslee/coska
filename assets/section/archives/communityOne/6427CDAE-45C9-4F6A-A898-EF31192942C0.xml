    <content>I am very thankful to all the people came last Friday for soft skills seminar. It was great experience and practice. I have learned a lot during preparation. Usually presenter becomes the most benefit from the seminar. I thank everyone that gave the chance to present the materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
I have little bits of regret too. Because I tried to cover as much as possible in given time. I felt like that I only covered the surface of all the fields but the same time wasn't enough. Maybe I mislead due lack of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
Anyway it was good start. If I get the other chances, I like to discuss about "Leadership". Probably leadership is the most difficult to acquire among all soft skills. Because it asks "WHY". Other soft skills need "HOW"&#xD;
&#xD;
Thanks again and until next time. &#xD;

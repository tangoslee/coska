    <content>I am going to close my summer office, my garage, for temporary.&#xD;
After I'd clean up my office about three week ago. I had invited my COMM1 friends and enjoyed nice chat over ice cold beers and smoking. Names are Lee Sung ki, Kang Dong Keung, Hwang sung Young, Han jong Hee and Okid family. My plan was inviting all Community family over the summer. I like to discuss or usually argument about everything. Thanks for listening my nonsense thoughts my distinguish invitees. Scott was my regular guest over many summer nights. Those I missed I am sorry. As soon as I reopen my office under my wife's approval, hopefully I can invite you all. Or please give me a call if you want to come. It is the way I am enjoying my summer after Worldcup syndrome. Specially Andrew Shin, our last remaining bachelor, I want to hear from you. I like to know about how your marriage business is holding up.&#xD;
&#xD;
ps : Please inform my vicious wife to reopen my summer office. Additionally I am not doing anything most of the nights. Please come over and entertain me. Thanks for your continueous support&#xD;
Long Live Madame Lee, my wife Dianne and unborn baby.&#xD;
I am going to name my unborn baby to WooJoo(Universe) regardless of gender. Let me know what you think.</content>

    <content>Once upon a time there was a frog who lived in a lake all by himself.  He had been given special powers by a local witch.  One day he finally ventured out of the lake to get his first glimpse of the world outside. &#xD;
The first thing he saw was a bear chasing a rabbit and so he called out to them and asked them to stop. &#xD;
 &#xD;
Then he said to them: "I am a magical frog and since you are the first two animals I have ever seen, I am going to grant you both three wishes.  Y ou will each take turns using them and you have to use them now." &#xD;
&#xD;
The bear (being greedy) went first. I would like for every bear in this forest to be female except for me."  A magical sound and it was done. &#xD;
Then the rabbit. "I would like a helmet." &#xD;
This confused both the frog and the bear, but after a magical sound there was a helmet. &#xD;
It was the bear's turn again. "I would like for every bear in the neighboring forest to be female." A magical sound and it was done. &#xD;
The rabbit went again. "I would like a motorcycle." &#xD;
&#xD;
Both the frog and the bear wondered why the rabbit didn't just ask for a lot of money with which he could buy himself a motorcycle, but after a magical sound there was a motorcycle. The bear took his last wish. "I would like for all the bears in the world to be female except for me." &#xD;
A magical sound and it was done. &#xD;
 &#xD;
The rabbit then put on his helmet, started up the motorcycle, and said &#xD;
"I wish the bear was gay" and took off like a bat out of hell. &#xD;

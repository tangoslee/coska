    <content>Here we go again!.....Software development company in midtown TORONTO is looking for a C++ “code junkie” -  someone who loves to code and who can do so from specifications.  The company DOES NOT WANT APPLICATION DEVELOPERS.  The successful candidate must also have experience with WINDOWS C (MOBILE WINDOWS), graphics design (not UI), but low level graphics and experience with TCP/IP would be a definite asset.  This is a permanent position.  This company will pay top dollar for the right candidate.  The package also includes a personal and corporate based bonus as well as stock offering.  The company is currently registered on the TSX.  If you are interested in this position and feel that you have the necessary qualifications, please send resume and salary expectations to neil.russell@rogers.com.  If you are not interested, but could refer a suitable candidate, it would be appreciated.&#xD;

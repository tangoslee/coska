I can say that I don't know the different characterisics and how-to for developing a system based on J2EE between Websphere and WebLogic. But most of relative developers have been experienced those.&#xD;
&#xD;
Recently, Web Gain relesed a composition product - 'WebGain Studio' and the apperance of it was a must and a trend in the future, I think. Because of the complexity and difficulties in the development with EJBs, such products will be appeared again and again for a whie.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Easy, Automatical implementation and Reusable modules' is their common goal and it is what we need,too.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nowadays in Korea, there are many and various attemps to develop a new system or to updated the current system using EJBs. These are mostly to the EC systems and it is a problem here that specialist of system architects and EJB designers are so few, either. I have not heard that there is a company who has pure human resourses of those, so they design it by their own employees or experienced experts. It shows how we can make a lot of money ... ^^;&#xD;
&#xD;
What methodology did you apply to your system? It's what I wanted to ask you.&#xD;
&#xD;
As I mentioned, we are at the beginning of adapting to EJBs' world. So I just expect that some standards or indications of development will be settled and announced sometime.&#xD;
&#xD;
Good luck to us.</content>

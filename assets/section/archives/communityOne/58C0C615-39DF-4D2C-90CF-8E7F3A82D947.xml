    <content>Does anybody have used checkLogon Tag Library in Struts?&#xD;
I implemented the Tag in an application but it doesn't work.&#xD;
How can I implement this tag for checking logon status?&#xD;
In the Struts document, the tag is used for checking logon status.&#xD;
In my understanding, this tag checks session and displays logon page after session time out.&#xD;
&#xD;
---------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
checkLogon - Checks for the existence of a particular session object, and forwards control to the logon page if it is missing. This is used to catch cases where a user has bookmarked a page in the middle of your application and tries to bypass logging on, or if the user's session has been timed out. &#xD;

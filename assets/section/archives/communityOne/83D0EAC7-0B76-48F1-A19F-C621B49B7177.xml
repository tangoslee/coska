    <content>Actual distance between mine to his is about 2 km or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mentally the distance was far. Only way to travel from mine to his was by auto vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mean of transportation&#xD;
Pre summer      : by Car only&#xD;
After summer   : by Car or by Bicycle after witnessing of Scott’s bicycle trip to my home&#xD;
After my running class : by Car, by Bicycle, or on foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
Span of about 4 months now I have few more options to travel to Scott’s home. Once I broke the mental wall of traveling Scott’s home by car only. Life is not better but it is little bit more enjoyable.&#xD;
&#xD;
                          Pros                Cons&#xD;
By car               fast                  costly&#xD;
 &#xD;
By Bicycle        good break     no cost other than tire friction&#xD;
&#xD;
On foot             good excise     no cost other than my increasing appetite&#xD;

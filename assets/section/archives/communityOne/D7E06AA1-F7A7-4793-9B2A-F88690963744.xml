    <content>Dear Travis&#xD;
&#xD;
I am writing to see if you might be interested in one of the following contract positions. One of the banks downtown is looking for 2 contractors to work as testers on their web applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
The first position is for a fully bilingual (french/english) tester - the start date is from January 23rd to March 14th and the hourly rate for someone who is incorporated is $35ph maximum. &#xD;
&#xD;
The second position is for a functional Tester of various web based applications and the pay is $20ph. This is working in the same department and the contract runs from January 23rd to March 14th.&#xD;
&#xD;
If you are interested and qualified for either of the above positions please let me know. Alternatively if you know of someone who would be looking please have them call me. &#xD;
&#xD;
Many thanks for your time &#xD;

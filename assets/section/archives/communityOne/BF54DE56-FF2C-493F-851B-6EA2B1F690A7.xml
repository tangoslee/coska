    <content>Hi Scott...&#xD;
I do challenge you in breast stroke style&#xD;
when : anytime&#xD;
where : any swimming pool&#xD;
distance : 100 m&#xD;
&#xD;
I have been swimming for about 40 days. I can swim 400 m in 25 minutes non-stop. I think I can keep up with you. After this challenge Spencer is next on the line then Steve.&#xD;
&#xD;
Other news : Now I am in the popular group at River Grove swimming pool at 6:30 to 7:30 group.&#xD;
&#xD;
My strategy :&#xD;
- Smile and hi first to everybody first 10 days&#xD;
- find who is the popular person out&#xD;
- ask questions of swimming&#xD;
- listen carefully like you really mean sincerely&#xD;
&#xD;
By product :&#xD;
- friendship buildup : I have many friends&#xD;
- I start my day with my new found friends&#xD;
- good tips : without questions it could take longer&#xD;
- multiple tips from many : pick and choose and make my own&#xD;
- my running helped a lot&#xD;
  used the same tactic - divide and conquer&#xD;
                                     not faster but longer&#xD;
&#xD;
Hi Scott come on down. Your ass is mine&#xD;

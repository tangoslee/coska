    <content>The system's master environment block is normally owned by the shell COMMAND.COM. COMMAND.COM creates this set of environment strings in memory from the contents of the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, using the SET, PATH, and PROMPT commands. The initial size of COMMAND.COM's environment block can be controlled by loading COMMAND.COM with the /E parameter, using the SHELL directive in CONFIG.SYS. For example: &#xD;
&#xD;
   SHELL=COMMAND.COM &lt;font color=blue&gt;&lt;b&gt;/E:2048&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; /P &#xD;
&#xD;
This line in CONFIG.SYS sets the initial size of COMMAND.COM's environment to 2K. The maximum size the environment can be set to is 32K; the default size is 160 bytes. (The /P option prevents COMMAND.COM from terminating, keeping it in memory until the system is restarted.) &#xD;

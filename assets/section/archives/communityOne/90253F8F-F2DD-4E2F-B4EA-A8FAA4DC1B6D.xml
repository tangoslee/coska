            <content>아하 그렇군요. 역시 고수님께 많은 것을 배우게 됩니다. 그렇다면 그 퍼포먼스 차이에 대해 구체적으로 좀 더 언급해 주실 수는 있을런지요.</content>

    <content>As I commented in the source code, there are 2 methods for Value Object as well as EJB methods.  So you can call not only EJB methods but also methods for value object.(Am I missed something?, I didn't post AccountValue class code but you can figure out how AccountValue class look like).&#xD;

If you test value object calling vs EJB methods calling. You will notice the performance difference. Of course it depends on how many calls are made.</content>

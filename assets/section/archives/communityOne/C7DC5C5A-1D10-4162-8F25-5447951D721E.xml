    <content>Today's topic is not for you, but for me.&#xD;
&#xD;
Based on the OOC(Object Oriented Concept), I'd like to ask myself some questions like...&#xD;
&#xD;
1. What kinds of 'classes' do I have?&#xD;
&#xD;
2. What and how many methods do I have or have implemented?&#xD;
&#xD;
At the first question, the 'Class' I meant is like the situation I can meet while I'm living. For example, 'When I meet a stranger who is not friendly and is even hostile to me' is a class. To deal with this object, I have to prepare or have implemented the 'Methods' at question 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
As one example for the method, there could be 'I say good words to the person'. The definition is like...&#xD;
&#xD;
private static String praise (Person stranger) {&#xD;
   ...&#xD;
}&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, you will be able to understand what I want to talk about. As a matter of fact, I, a middle-thiry aged person, have not tried to build up many Classes and Methods of each so far. There are also many 'Interfaces' which I just put off to implement to use in the real world. Actually there was no motive to struggle to do that, but I want to start this project of my own because I became stimulated by you. I appreciate those who can be my paragon.&#xD;

    <content>All of us get challenged by all kind of things. It could be work related, monetary, love, raising a kid, so on and so forth. We can't not avoid the challenges. It will find you no matter what or no matter where. However how to response to challenge will differentiate boy to man or girl to woman. In a way these challenges make the life interesting and exciting. Without it life could be very boring. We get our own share of challenges. It packages itself to many different forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
Without Cuba's nuclear John F. Kennedy could be remembered as a girl chaser. &#xD;
Without Civil war Lincoln could be skinny tall small time country lawyer.&#xD;
Without Java we would not have Comm1.&#xD;
&#xD;
When there is challenge/change people reacts in four phases as I read from some newspaper article.&#xD;
- Denial : try not to face the fact&#xD;
- Anguish : because of lack of personal preparation people try to blame something or someone&#xD;
- Despair : giving up. wait for the worst&#xD;
- Understanding/Acceptance : adopt the situation&#xD;
&#xD;
Everyone goes through these conceptual phases when we face the challenges. If it is small, who cares what you deal with it. But it is big task. We better have some kind of our own process to deal with it. Questions is how to minimize denial, anguish, despair phases and focus on understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
We had our common challenge called "Immigration"&#xD;
It was very big and not easy challenge. If we scrutinize what we had done from the beginning to settle down in Canada, it could provide the good process.&#xD;
&#xD;
Like everything else pratice makes it perfect. Let's give ourselves head start.&#xD;

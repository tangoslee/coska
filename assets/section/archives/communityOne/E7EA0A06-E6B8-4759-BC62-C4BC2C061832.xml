    <content>It Requests a Raise&#xD;
Author：Unknown    From：Internet    Hits：186&#xD;
&#xD;
I hereby request a raise in salary for the following reasons: &#xD;
I do physical labor &#xD;
I work at great depths &#xD;
I plunge head first into everything I do &#xD;
I do not get weekends off or public holidays &#xD;
I work in a damp environment &#xD;
I don't get paid overtime &#xD;
I work in a dark workplace that has poor ventilation &#xD;
I work in high temperatures &#xD;
My work exposes me to contagious diseases &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Dear It, &#xD;
&#xD;
After assessing your request, and considering the arguments you have raised, the administration rejects your request for the following reasons: &#xD;
&#xD;
You do not work 8 hours straight &#xD;
You fall asleep on the job after brief work period &#xD;
You do not always follow the orders of the management team &#xD;
You do not stay in your allocated position, and often visit other areas &#xD;
You do not take initiative - you need to be pressured and stimulated in order to start working &#xD;
You leave the workplace rather messy at the end of your shift &#xD;
You don't always observe necessary safety regulations, such as wearing the correct protective clothing &#xD;
You'll retire well before reaching 65 &#xD;
You're unable to work double shifts &#xD;
You sometimes leave your allocated position before you have completed the day's work. And if that were not all, you have been seen constantly entering and leaving the workplace carrying 2 suspicious looking bags. &#xD;
&#xD;
Sincerely, &#xD;
The Management &#xD;
 &#xD;

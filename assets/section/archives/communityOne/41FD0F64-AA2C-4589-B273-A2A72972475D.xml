    <content>I couldn't get into this comm1 site 'cause it uses non 80 or 8080 port and our company firewall policy does not let the request through if the port num is not well-known one like telnet 25, http 80 etc..&#xD;
&#xD;
Now I can access this comm1 from my desktop com in the office after setting proxy server, that uses port 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
So all my HTTP requests going outside are through that&#xD;
80-port proxy server and the firewall let them go&#xD;
out. The final destination URL is with non-80 port num but&#xD;
that URL is requested through the proxy server I set, so&#xD;
the final destination is transparant to the firewall.&#xD;

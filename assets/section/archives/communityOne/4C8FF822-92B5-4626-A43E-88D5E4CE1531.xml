    <content>From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this: What Makes100%? What does it mean to give MORE than 100%? &#xD;
&#xD;
Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%? &#xD;
&#xD;
We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over &#xD;
100%. &#xD;
&#xD;
How about achieving 103%? &#xD;
&#xD;
Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these &#xD;
questions: &#xD;
&#xD;
What makes up 100% in life? &#xD;
&#xD;
If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z &#xD;
&#xD;
is represented as: &#xD;
&#xD;
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26. &#xD;
&#xD;
Then: &#xD;
&#xD;
H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K = 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 =98% &#xD;
&#xD;
and &#xD;
&#xD;
K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E = 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 =96% &#xD;
&#xD;
But, &#xD;
&#xD;
A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E = 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 =100% &#xD;
&#xD;
And, &#xD;
&#xD;
B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T = 2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103% &#xD;
&#xD;
AND, look how far ass kissing will take you. &#xD;
&#xD;
A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G = 1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 =118% &#xD;
&#xD;
So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that: &#xD;
&#xD;
While Hard work and knowledge will get you close, and, Attitude will get &#xD;
you there, &#xD;
&#xD;
Bullshit and Ass kissing will put you over the top &#xD;

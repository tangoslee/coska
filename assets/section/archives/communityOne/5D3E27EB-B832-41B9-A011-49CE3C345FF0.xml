    <content>Hi everyone,&#xD;
Today my company got attacked by Goner virus,&#xD;
Now I'm still getting a bunch of e-mail sent by co-workers.&#xD;
around over 1000 e-mails so far.&#xD;
This virus has some feature as following:&#xD;
1) subject: Hi&#xD;
2) Context: When I saw this screen saver, I immediately thought about you.&#xD;
&#xD;
The attached file name is "Goner.scr".&#xD;
If you open this attached file, you'll get infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
So be careful, everyone.&#xD;
P/S I had to turn mail alarm off, it's so annoying now.&#xD;

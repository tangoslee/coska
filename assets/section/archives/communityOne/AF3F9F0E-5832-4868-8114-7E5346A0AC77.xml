    <content>I got this mail from my ex-director. &#xD;
If you have any experience of Java with C#, please send me your CV ASAP with your hourly rate.&#xD;
I will check your resume and forward to the director.&#xD;
He is not a job agent, he is the director of the company that I worked for. &#xD;
&#xD;
Thanks&#xD;

    <content>Storage market is in the exactly same situation. Market should be double every year but it did not happen. I think there are a few reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
- Stock Market Crush&#xD;
- Technology did not meet expectation&#xD;
- End users was not ready&#xD;
&#xD;
Prediction : Market will correct itself. it is coming but slowly. Java was going to be holy grail of the technology. It was too complicated and no infra to support.  Internet, Java (.net) and Storage are in the same family tree. Internet is here to stay. There are no doubts but free Internet stuffs are gone. We better get used to paying things. When it happens we will be suprised big time for good reasons. &#xD;

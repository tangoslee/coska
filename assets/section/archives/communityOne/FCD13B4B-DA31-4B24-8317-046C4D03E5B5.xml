-- JavaServer Faces --&#xD;
&#xD;
JavaServer Faces technology simplifies building user interfaces for&#xD;
JavaServer applications. With the well-defined programming model that&#xD;
JavaServer Faces provides, developers of varying skill levels can&#xD;
quickly and easily build web applications by: assembling reusable UI&#xD;
components in a page, connecting these components to an application&#xD;
data source, and wiring client-generated events to server-side event&#xD;
handlers. With the power of JavaServer Faces technology, these web&#xD;
applications handle all of the complexity of managing the user&#xD;
interface on the server, allowing the application developer to focus&#xD;
on application code&#xD;
&#xD;
Poised to become the preeminent--not to mention standard--Java Web&#xD;
application framework, JavaServer Faces is the next big thing for&#xD;
server-side Java. Come find out what all the fuss is about in this&#xD;
cutting-edge session given by a member of the JSF Expert Group. Learn&#xD;
what JSF has to offer, how it compares to Struts, and how you can&#xD;
start using it today.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <content>When I was one the way to work, I read an interesting article about job hunting on the subway.&#xD;
The paper says only 10 percent of the whole jobs are one the internet or on the news paper.&#xD;
Most of jobs are the hidden ones.   So how can we find that hiddend jobs?&#xD;
The answer is very simple which is "use your network".&#xD;
First, make a list of your network including everyone you've had an acquaintance so far,&#xD;
such as friends of friends, bank manager, hair-dresser ,whoever it is.&#xD;
Second, call them and ask them to do you a favor for ten minutes,&#xD;
Don't ask them if they could provide you with information of job openings now,&#xD;
but you should start with your situation in job hunting and tell them what kind of skills you have and&#xD;
what sort of job do you want, and check with them if they know somebody who can help you out about it.&#xD;
and then make sure to call them again and  check if they are looking into the possiblity of finding someone&#xD;
who can be of a big help to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
Maybe it is nothing new to us.&#xD;
If you alreay knew about it, why don't you put it in practice right away?&#xD;
&#xD;
-end-&#xD;

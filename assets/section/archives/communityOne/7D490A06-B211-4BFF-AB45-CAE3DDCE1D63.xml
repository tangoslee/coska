    <content>Thank you - the first session attendants.&#xD;
&#xD;
As I said, the second session will be held on the 30th, Saturday morning. It will be the same starting time, but not the same place maybe. I will inform you in private as soon as it is decided.&#xD;
&#xD;
Belows are the topics for the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
- XLink&#xD;
- XPointer&#xD;
- XMLSchema&#xD;
- DOM&#xD;
&#xD;
* You should not print out the file I gave you because I modified some pages, so I will prepare them like before.&#xD;
&#xD;
* Newly updated PDF file will be delivered to everyone before the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
* Review of 'XSL' is recommended. It'll make it easier to follow up every concept or example that'll be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
Happy XML! See you.</content>

    <content>Prompt payment&#xD;
&#xD;
I have a distant cousin in the insurance business who once engaged in a very hot debate with a rival agent on the merits of their respective companies.&#xD;
The rival declared, "There is no company like ours for prompt payment. If one of our clients dies on Monday, the heirs have our check in full by Tuesday morning."&#xD;
My cousin was visibly unimpressed. &#xD;
"Our head office," he declared, "is located on the 45th floor of the Empire State Building. One morning last week a client jumped out of a window on the 70th floor. We handed him his check as he passed our floor." </content>

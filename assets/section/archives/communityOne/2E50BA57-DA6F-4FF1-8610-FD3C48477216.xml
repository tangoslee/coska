    <content>Vaadin is a relatively new and modern framework for web app development.&#xD;
&#xD;
I've just kickstart developing with it for another project, and it looks quite interesting.&#xD;
&#xD;
IMO, it is better than Struts, Stripes, Wicket, and Spring MVC in terms of getting away from silly JSP/HTML trivial (but huge amount of) jobs. Yes, Vaadin lets you work on serverside what you've mostly have done in those kind of presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
Data Model wise, even though it supports a whole different way of JPA, I prefer the layered and traditional approach so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
Try some demo at their official website. It's free of course including the reference book.&#xD;

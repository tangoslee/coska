    <content>I believe most members have high knowledge in JAVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
For beginners or short experienced person, I would introduce WEB site of two part time classes in Seneca College. &#xD;
&#xD;
One is OOP course based on JAVA. The other is JAVA I course.&#xD;
&#xD;
OOP 		http://www3.sympatico.ca/blackw/  &#xD;
JAVA I	         http://people.senecac.on.ca/newman.seto/&#xD;
&#xD;
It could be helpful to understand the level or direction of part time class in College.&#xD;
If you want to learn any technical skills, I would recommend attending part time classes.&#xD;

    <content>Hi, everyone.&#xD;
&#xD;
Recently James Lee recommended me using JUnitDoclet when it comes to unit tests with JUnit since sometimes (actually mostly) it really bugs me creating test data except automatically generated class and method skeleton, which is provided by Eclipse.&#xD;
&#xD;
After researching JUnitDoclet, still I feel it's not so easy that I can't easily practice it in Eclipse platform. The explanation in the document is too short and even not matching with the current Eclipse 2.1 version.&#xD;
&#xD;
Do you have some experience like above? I think I might need a sort of manual or your directions. If there is, someone help me please.&#xD;
&#xD;
Thanks in advance.</content>

    <content>Hi Scott…..&#xD;
&#xD;
I like to congratulate you again for your successful publishing of Java book. At the same time I like to thank your wife, Lufina, for tasteful foods we had last night for behalf of Comm. One.   &#xD;
&#xD;
You mentioned of how difficult it was to complete a book. All the sleepless night and hard work you had to put it in. I can only imagine. I hope it is not the end of your writing career. I wish it is only the beginning. You set the very good example for other members. I wish that one of Comm. One member tops what you have done.&#xD;
&#xD;
I am not saying we should be combatively comparative rather constructively comparative. I shouldn’t be writing the book because Scott did it. More to I had seen how Scott did it. It wasn’t easy and it required a lot of hard works. But I like to challenge myself to become better person.&#xD;
&#xD;
I know you will set the higher bar for everybody. I know you will not stop rather you’re taking long deserved break to leap the next level. That way we will follow you to go the Promised Land.&#xD;
&#xD;
Now you like or not. You became Comm. One own flagship. Calling will come without warning. However it comes to right person. It knows where and how to find the right person. The person is you. Scott.&#xD;
&#xD;
Yours Sincerely&#xD;
&#xD;
Thomas Lee&#xD;

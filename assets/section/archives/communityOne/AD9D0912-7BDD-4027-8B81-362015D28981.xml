Thanks for your reply.&#xD;
&#xD;
Is your document re. Servlet/Tomcat most current? I am asking you because it contains the phrase,&#xD;

"Please ignore below step, I will post new step..."&#xD;
&#xD;
Anyway, it's good to hear from you.&#xD;
Enjoy your visit!&#xD;

&gt; Oh, You know where I am?, Central Library in Virginia Beach. This library is great. It's facility is modernized and looks like university library. Today's temperature is 91 F. I don't know the Celcius. This Virginia beach is great to play and relax. Thanks for your map paper. &#xD;

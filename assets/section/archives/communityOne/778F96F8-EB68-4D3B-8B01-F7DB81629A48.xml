On behalf of Canadians everywhere I'd like to offer an apology to the United States of America. We haven't been getting along very well recently and for that, I am truly sorry.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'm sorry we called George Bush a moron. He is a moron but, it wasn't nice of us to point it out. If it's any consolation, the fact that he's a moron shouldn't reflect poorly on the people of America. After all it's not like you actually elected him.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'm sorry about our softwood lumber. Just because we have more trees than you doesn't give us the right to sell you lumber that's cheaper and better than your own.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'm sorry we beat you in Olympic hockey. In our defense I guess our excuse would be that our team was much, much, much, much better than yours.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'm sorry we burnt down your white house during the war of 1812. I notice you've rebuilt it! It's Very Nice.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'm sorry about your beer. I know we had nothing to do with your beer but, we Feel your Pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'm sorry about our waffling on Iraq. I mean, when you're going up against a crazed dictator, you wanna have your friends by your side. I realize it took more than two years before you guys pitched in against Hitler, but that was different. Everyone knew he had weapons.&#xD;
&#xD;
And finally on behalf of all Canadians, I'm sorry that we're constantly apologizing for things in a passive-aggressive way which is really a thinly veiled criticism. I sincerely hope that you're not upset over this.&#xD;
&#xD;
We've seen what you do to countries you get upset with.&#xD;
&#xD;
Thank you.&#xD;

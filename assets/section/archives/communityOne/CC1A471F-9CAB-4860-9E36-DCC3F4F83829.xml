    <content>Hi Mr. Entrepreneur…&#xD;
&#xD;
I like to congratulate your first contact with Tell Us. I know it is only the beginning and you still have quite a distance to go. But 1000 miles starts from one step. You’re getting there slowly but surely.&#xD;
&#xD;
There is one notion I like to share with you and other members. “In Life it’s not the Destination. It’s the journey.” In life we all know our final destination. Yeah&#xD;
&#xD;
It is my own interpretation. I had struggled quite a bit to digest as my own. If it is not the destination, what about the future plan, vision and stuffs….. Finally I think I understood in my own term. There is always chance that my plan is not going to work or could delay. If the Destination is only concern, in above situations I will face many unhappiness. Butif I enjoyed the journey. If I don’t get to the destination I desired, I still have something I can cherish after math. &#xD;
&#xD;
Also it is my belief that when you’re in business, money is not the only reason. It is one of factors. Because you have to enjoy what you do. Otherwise there is no pot of gold in the end of rainbow. Just like “It’s not the Destination. It’s the journey.” Continuously you have to come up with next business plan in order to survive in the business jungle. If you do not enjoy, you will lose your edge.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Sincerely Yours&#xD;
&#xD;
I will continue to look over your sholuder  &#xD;

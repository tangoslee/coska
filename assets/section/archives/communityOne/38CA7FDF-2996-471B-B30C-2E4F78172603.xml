    <content>Everything I need to know, I learned from Noah's Ark... &#xD;
ONE: 	Don't miss the boat. &#xD;
TWO: 	Remember that we are all in the same boat. &#xD;
THREE: 	Plan ahead. It wasn't raining when Noah built the Ark. &#xD;
FOUR: 	Stay fit. When you're 60 years old, someone may ask you to do something really big. &#xD;
FIVE: 	Don't listen to critics; just get on with the job that needs to be done. &#xD;
SIX: 	Build your future on high ground. &#xD;
SEVEN: 	For safety's sake, travel in pairs. &#xD;
EIGHT: 	Speed isn't always an advantage. The snails were on board with the cheetahs. &#xD;
NINE: 	When you're stressed, float awhile. &#xD;
TEN: 	Remember, the Ark was built by amateurs; the Titanic by professionals. </content>

    <content>I was really impressed and sure that everyone had a good time. Unexpectedly, I found out there are still a lot of things to know as a database user, and I'm pretty certain the seminar (to be continued) will affect my attitude against solving real problems.&#xD;
I appreciate your consideration to give us good knowledges and I'm anxious to hear your wonderful class again.&#xD;
Oh, I nearly forgot to mention your perfect facility for the game we had. ^^&#xD;
Take care.</content>

    <content>An accountant decided to leave his wife one day.&#xD;
 &#xD;
He left her a note saying:&#xD;
"Dear Jane, I am 54 years old and I have never done anything wild. So I'm leaving you for an 18 year old blonde model.  We'll be staying at the Sheraton."&#xD;
&#xD;
He then packed his things and went there. When he&#xD;
arrived at the Sheraton, there was a message for him from his wife. It read:&#xD;
"Dear John. I too am 54 years old. I have followed your example and am staying at the Hyatt with an 18 year old Italian hunk.  And I'm sure that you, as an accountant, will appreciate that 18 goes into&#xD;
54 many many more times than 54 goes into 18!"&#xD;

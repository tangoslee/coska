    <content>Three men: a project manager, a software engineer, and a hardware engineer are in Ft.Lauderdale for a two-week period helping out on a project. &#xD;
&#xD;
About midweek they decide to walk up and down the beach during their lunch hour. Halfway up the beach, they stumbled upon a lamp. As they rub the lamp a genie appears and says "Normally I would grant you 3 wishes, but since there are 3 of you, I will grant you each one wish." &#xD;
&#xD;
The hardware engineer went first. "I would like to spend the rest of my life living in a huge house in St. Thomas, with no money worries and surrounded by beautiful women who worship me." The genie granted him his wish and sent him on off to St. Thomas. &#xD;
&#xD;
The software engineer went next. "I would like to spend the rest of my life living on a huge yacht cruising the Mediterranean, with no money worries and surrounded by beautiful women who worship me." The genie granted him his wish and sent him off to the Mediterranean. &#xD;
&#xD;
Last, but not least, it was the project manager's turn. "And what would your wish be?" asked the genie. &#xD;
&#xD;
"I want them both back after lunch" replied the project manager.</content>

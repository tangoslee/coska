            <content>Now I see there's no one who corresponds to the level I focused on in our Community. Wow!</content>

    <content>I'm just thinking that I'll open a seminar for XML beginners because I'm either. ^^ I know that we had several XML seminars, and it was not focused on easy stuff. But my seminar would be very basic and practical stuff. It means that we will deal with real codes and many sample data.&#xD;
&#xD;
So, I'd like to know how many people are in such level in Community One. Please attach a brief comment if you are interested and it will not be an English seminar. Also, I would be glad if there's a volunteer to help me correct or comment as a knowledgeable, experienced person.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'm not a XML specialist, but a student trying to utilize it in my programming. Thank you.&#xD;
&#xD;
- Below is not confirmed, but it's probable.&#xD;
&#xD;
* Starting time : 9 A.M. on November 16 (Saturday)&#xD;
* Preffered place : my home (I'll tell you later)&#xD;
* Duration : 9 AM ~ 12 AM&#xD;

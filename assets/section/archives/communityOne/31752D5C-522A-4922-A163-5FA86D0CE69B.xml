    <content>Process of evaluating &#xD;
&#xD;
I like to share what I felt last night Comm. One as a whole.  I felt we were looking at the things subjectively first then considering objectively later. It is very good way of looking at it if we want to contain only. But if we like to grow, I like to recommend that we consider whatever comes to us objectively first then evaluate subjectively.  I believe it could provide us more options.&#xD;
&#xD;
I will present what I am trying to say in our next seminar.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Sincerely Your&#xD;
&#xD;
I luv you ALL.&#xD;

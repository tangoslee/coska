    <content>IBM will be hosting their career fair at 3600 Steeles Ave. on Saturday&#xD;
September 22, 2001 from 9am - 5pm.  ( North on 404, exit at Steeles Ave.&#xD;
&#xD;
go East( right) 1 block, IBM wll be on the left.  Underground free parking)&#xD;
If anyone is interested people tell them to submit a resume online, as wellas bring a copy of their transcripts and several resumes to the career fair.&#xD;
&#xD;
Hiring managers will be on hand to "screen" and do " mini interviews". (informal)&#xD;
&#xD;
I would recommend anyone interested to talk to as many people as possible at the different booths( different booths for different areas), as well to be able to clearly explain what they know, what they want to do(programming, architecture, analyst...), and how they see their career&#xD;
progressing.&#xD;

    <content>CNE has been started like two weeks ago. That is the sign of the end of summer. I hope everyone had good summer and still enjoy it what's remainder of the summer.&#xD;
&#xD;
Beginning of the summer I set a few resolutions to myself.&#xD;
- Write my own memoir for my daughter by her graduation in 4 years&#xD;
- 100 days Baby Countdown Journal&#xD;
- Tell my wife "I love you" at least three times per day&#xD;
- I like to run 5 km short marathon by the end of summer&#xD;
&#xD;
Above four items were my summer resolutions.&#xD;
Cut long story to short - results have not been bad.&#xD;
It could be better or worse but not bad overall&#xD;
&#xD;
Results&#xD;
- My memoir long way to go I planned to write 100 articles for next four years. I had written 5 or 6. I know I can write. I know I could do&#xD;
- 100 days countdown baby journal&#xD;
  I haven't written the journal daily base but I have written 2 or 3 stories per week. &#xD;
- "I love you" I done it at the beginning. But lately I haven't done it. Just lack of effort. This is the easiest them all. Only thing I need to do is just say it. Need more effort. I should call my wife at least once per day.&#xD;
- 5 km marathon&#xD;
  I am tried of running. Now I am riding bicycle everyday for last three weeks. Once in the morning and once in the night. Also I've register community center course " How to run". I think I need to inform how to run. Start day is Sep 7 for 6 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
Overall I am satisfied with what I've done. It is not the best results I was expecting but better than not setting resolutions. I've done stuffs and I had fun doing them.&#xD;
&#xD;
So how was your summer ? Did you have fun ?&#xD;

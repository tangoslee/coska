    <content>I just want u to consider the reason why some members did not write their private information.&#xD;
&#xD;
In my case I'd be glad to but I couldn't. Why? I'm in Korea and I work for the company I can't reveal now.&#xD;
&#xD;
Conclusionally, If u all support the policy leveraging members because of a regional fact ... I will follow ur decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
I will expect to be a formal member after immigration some day.&#xD;
&#xD;
Thanks.</content>

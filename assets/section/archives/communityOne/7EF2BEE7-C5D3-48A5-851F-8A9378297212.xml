    <content>Niagara Syndrome : start calm and slowly but there is downfall at the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
Life starts calm and simple at the beginning. When you get the stream of life most of us lose the control and we become busy coping with it. Just like we are in the stream of Niagara Falls. It starts calm but soon current of stream gets faster and rage. If we do not have the clear goals and directions, we easily get into fast stream of what we call the life. We are busy coping with family, marriage, career, and etc. Initially we have the goal not crystal clear but certain directions what we want to be in 10, 20 years down the road. Before we are ready most of time the thing called the life will grab us in the leg and doesn’t let go. We become busy getting back the control but we go into the deeper hole. Say to us “I will do it tomorrow or when I get the promotion I will start and etc.”.&#xD;
&#xD;
By the time we think “Maybe I can start the future plan” there is the big falls like Niagara Falls with neither a boat nor an oar. Some will survive and some will not. I had been there. Luckily I coped with it because I am lucky not because I was ready. There will be other falls. Am I going to be lucky again ? I like to put myself into better odds. I am going to start the plan from now. I want to be a survivor.&#xD;

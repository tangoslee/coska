아직 장미꽃이 피지 않아서인지 무료입니다.&#xD;

With the world's largest lilac collection and a rare Carolinian forest, the Royal Botanical Gardens receives international praise and admiration. The landscape--framed by the Niagara Escarpment and Lake Ontario--is the perfect backdrop for flowering plants, hedges, roses and magnolias. Enclosed in the garden's 2,700 acres is a thriving wetland and intricate ecosystem that includes deer, coyotes, muskrat and blue heron. Even the youngest children enjoy the bright colors and abundant wildlife. They can also learn about plants and nature at the children's discovery garden. The autumn herb festival attracts families every year with gourmet food and wine tasting, and children's activities and games.--Lisa Young&#xD;

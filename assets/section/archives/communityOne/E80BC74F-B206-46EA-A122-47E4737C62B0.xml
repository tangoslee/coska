    <content>Can we add eXtreme Programming methodology ?&#xD;
&#xD;
In order to implement XP there are 4 integral factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
Communication: Problems with projects often can be traced back to somebody not talking to somebody else about something important at some point. XP makes it almost impossible not to communicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
Simplicity: XP proposes that you always do the simplest thing that could possibly work with regard to process and writing code. The way Kent puts it, "XP is making a bet. It is betting that it is better to do a simple thing today . . . than to do a more complicated thing today that may never be used anyway."&#xD;
&#xD;
Feedback: Concrete feedback early and often from the customer, from the team, and from real end users gives you more opportunity to "steer" your efforts. Feedback keeps you on the road and out of the ditch.&#xD;
&#xD;
Courage: Courage exists within the context of the other three values. They all support each other. It takes courage to trust that concrete feedback along the way is better than trying to know everything up front. It takes courage to talk to others on the team when that might expose some of your own ignorance. It takes courage to keep the system simple, deferring tomorrow's decisions until tomorrow. And without a simple system, constant communication to spread knowledge, and feedback to steer with, it's tough to be brave. &#xD;
&#xD;
I think it can help to complete the project.</content>

    <content>As the title says, you should answer and explain similar but different collection objects' features. There might be several questions on real examples which object is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
These are the objects frequently mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
1. Vector vs. ArrayList&#xD;
2. Hashtable vs. HashMap&#xD;
3. String vs. StringBuffer&#xD;
&#xD;
Anything else? please attach your ideas. Thanks.</content>

    <content>I've seen many Koreans and Canadians since I came to Canada.&#xD;
Also, I have seen extremely bad habits from Koreans.&#xD;
&#xD;
I am going to talk about one of those today. &#xD;
&#xD;
Do you see or glance at someone who is talking to you? Even though it is an open meeting, such a person just speak and does not pay attention (they listen maybe). You might think that you don't, but are you sure? &#xD;
&#xD;
I found out several people do that way in our community, too. I don't know what he/she intend for doing so. But why do you harm yourself? Perhaps it is very natural for him/her, but it seems they are rude and neglecting people. How about you?&#xD;
&#xD;
Unfortunately, the stereotype caused by a unconscious habit will last very longer (than you expect), and it is generally impossible to eliminate or recover it by your own effort although it is in a severe situation. But, usually, you will not perceive that you gave any chanes to people, or not know how to solve the uncomfortable relation.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'm not talking about the first impression. If you don't pay positive attention in communication, it means that you despise people. Let's try not to trap yourself just showing indifference.&#xD;

    <content>Well it has been exactly one month since you posted your inquiry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me give you my answer and opinion...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. The Job market is still very depressing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. The school you are asking about is unknown to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. To find a job, you could contact agencies. However, they do &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; not pay much attention to new comers like yourself because of&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; communication problem. Also they want candidate who has Canadian&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; experience.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You could contact companies directly, but this is not an efficient&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; approach because they are constantly bombarded with resumes&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; of good candidates from agencies.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Also you could use job posting in Newspaper or Manpower, but &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I rarely see any advertisement these days except some &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; management position.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You could also use Web Sites (see on Home page of COSKA.COM),&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and this is mostly recommended,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; however, remember there are so many people applying for it.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So the chance of getting an interview is slim unless&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; you have a skill in demand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. It is very unfortunate that the current job market in IT &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; is very bad overall, not like few years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You might even have to take any job to survive in the mean time.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; According to the statistics, there are still high percentage of &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; unemployment among Canadian .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I wish you all the Best and good luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; BTW, it is my personal opinion, and I hope it is some help to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;안녕하세요?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;예전에 남겼던 글들은 모두 없어졌네요. --;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;정리를 하신건지...&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;전 내년 초쯤 랜딩예정인데요, 한국에선 자바개발, 설계파트에서&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;일을 했습니다.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;궁금한게 있는데요.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;이민자들이 캐나다 가서 취직하기 위해선 보통 어떤 방법들이 있나요?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;물론 영어공부부터 해야겠져?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;직업학교라는게 있는거 같던데, 구체적으로 어떤 건가요?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;co-op과는 다른건가요?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;거기에 입학할려면 어떻게 해야하나요?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;갈 날은 다가오는데, 점점더 막연한 기분이라 답답합니다.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;또, 뱅쿠버쪽에는 그런 학교가 현저히 적은거 같던데, 제가 잘 몰라서 그런거겠죠?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;(전 사실 아직 랜딩 예정지도 못정한 상태입니다.)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;바쁘시겠지만, 답글 부탁드립니다.&lt;br&gt;</content>

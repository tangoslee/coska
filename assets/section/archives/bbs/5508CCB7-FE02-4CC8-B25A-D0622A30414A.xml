    <content>Good Reference in Korea.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; : Well-Known companies (LG, Samsung), If you have reference from such a company, you will not be asked for reference in any job market.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What if you have a good reference in Korea ,and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;one company ask you for reference , they can email or call them to check your reference. Do not think that no one calls one of your ex-coworkers on your reference!!!&lt;br&gt;If you do not have it, find someone to be your good reference in Korea.&lt;br&gt;2. Enough communication ability in English&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;: There are some levels to evaluate Someone's English ability.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you do not have&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;any problem to explain in English what you think and what you write to someone you do not know, I do not think that you need to worry about your English ability.&lt;br&gt;3. Required skills in Job Market&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;: This one is really related to the second Item.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sometimes, Over 10 years working experience in C++&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;does not work.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you have real working experience with the skill set what companies in Canada wants, you will get better opportunity rather than someone just&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;having over 10 years programming experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do not afraid of trying something you want!!!&lt;br&gt;Once you think something, you are just close enough to your final goal.&lt;br&gt;</content>

    <content>I think this speech is good to listen to so I introduce here.&lt;br&gt;One my dilemma. I can't write down at coska website at my home.&lt;br&gt;It's very weird because I can use any other Korean website at home but only for the coska I can't write down for any bulletin board.&lt;br&gt;I can't use Korean at my office.

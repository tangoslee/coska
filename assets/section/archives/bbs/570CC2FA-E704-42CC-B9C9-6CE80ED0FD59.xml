    <content>Hello, members!&lt;br&gt;I am Paul Yoon (Korean Name: 윤석규). I like our home page very much and it didn't have any problem until I upgraded my browser. Recently I upgraded it to MS IE 6.0 (the lastest version). After that, I have got a runtime error whenever I click any link in COSKA web page. Does any of you get the same experience? If this one is not only my problem, I think it is supposed to be fixed.&lt;br&gt;Thank you.&lt;br&gt;</content>

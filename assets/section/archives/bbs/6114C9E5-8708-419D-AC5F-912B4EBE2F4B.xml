    <content>Dear member,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have heard a good news from the Korean Senior Community this afternoon.&lt;br&gt;There are 35 people who want to take our complimentary PC EDUCATION PROGRAM for Korean senior people.&lt;br&gt;But we have only 8 people who have shown their willingness to be a volunteer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I will really appreciate if anyone makes up their mind to participate this event as a volunteer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more, the merrier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sheon</content>

His wife will pick up the phone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Luck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sheon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Yoon wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; Hello everybody,&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; I am a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Right now, my experience lies in software development and testing but I wish to pursue a career as a Oracle DBA.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have looked into various programs available, but am unsure as to the best approach for such an area.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt; Could anyone provide any advice into this matter?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content>

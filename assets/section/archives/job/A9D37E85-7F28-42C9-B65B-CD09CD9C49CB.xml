    <content>I have a short term project that requires Excel (Macro) programming. If you are interested, email to info@borasoft.com no later than Nov. 23. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Make it short and no resume necessary but you should be prepared to demo (or make a presentation of) your portfolio and working knowledge.</content>

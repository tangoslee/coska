    <content>Hello Every one,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;went to that Brass Ring's recent Job Fair on June 18th and 19th&lt;br&gt;at Toronto Convention Center&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There wasn't that much of participants from recruiter side even though &lt;br&gt;you had quite a number of job seekers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Internet bubble burst,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the paradigm in IT might have been changed.&lt;br&gt;Most recruiters are from manufacturing or financial related. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I apolosize my mistyping ^.^ I can not help but to mis-type. ^.^;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; communication skill might be considered more important in recent&lt;br&gt;job search because financial and brick and motar compnaies usually want somebody &lt;br&gt;with industry knowledge-domain knowledge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the skill set, they need C, C++ and UNIX more than ever. This is quite a paradigm &lt;br&gt;shift.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mission-Critical enterprise application and system development expereince is &lt;br&gt;also valued (ERP, H/A, SAN and that type of thing)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, even for those system administors, specific package experience (such as SAP) &lt;br&gt;seems to be valued by employers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there anybody who happened to have SAP or Oracle Financial related project &lt;br&gt;expereice? We might form a stduy group because getting SAP or Oracle app.&lt;br&gt;project experience is die-hard to get regardless of places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even in Korea(I had 1 year contract in Korea upuntil alst month), SAP or Oracle App.&lt;br&gt;project has been sustained, postphoned and canceled for last three years. This lack is &lt;br&gt;causing a lot of trouble in Korea like no Korean ERP consultant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anybody with enough of industry specific work process and BPR knowledge can be &lt;br&gt;trained as SAP or Oracle App. consultant.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have very large collection of SAP ERP&lt;br&gt;books on consulting, BPR, pjt, implementation and etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I even have ISP(IT Strategic Planning )consulting project with HP consulting Korea, &lt;br&gt;AT Kearny Korea and Gap Gemini Earnst and Young Korea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If interested, please contact me at cosmos@visto.com&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank yu,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jay S.

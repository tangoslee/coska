    <content>Quoted &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\\&amp;quot; As far as your question with regards to interviewing - the best thing the candidate can do is listen carefully to the person interviewing him/her. They may discuss what the main skills the company is looking for - The candidate should highlight his/her experience regarding those skills (top 2 or 3 skills she can discuss).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously, she will not know the skills the other candidates have but if she presents herself to be the \\&amp;quot;best qualified\\&amp;quot; for the position, it will be helpful.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The other thing a candidate should do is to try to \\&amp;quot;stand out\\&amp;quot; so the people interviewing him/her will remember him/her and want to see the candidate again for a second interview. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The candidate should also try to be confident of themselves and their skills - but try NOT to be TOO confident that they \\&amp;quot;turn off\\&amp;quot; the people interviewing them. \\&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quoted from a memo by James Lee at W5&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</content>

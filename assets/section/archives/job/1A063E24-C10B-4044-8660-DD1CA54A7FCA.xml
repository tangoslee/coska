    <content>Yes, I am thinking of referral fee.&lt;br&gt;*******************************&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this time, my client is looking for someone with SharePoint 2007 Development, however because this is a new technology, the requirements of this position might change. If so, I will connect with you as you have some great experiences. I will also keep you in mind, should we have another position come available, I will connect with you directly.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Do you know anyone with SharePoint 2007 experience? We offer referral fees for successful placements.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Thanks so much for your interest, &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Jenn Metzloff&lt;br&gt;Recruiter&lt;br&gt;PROCOM, Waterloo&lt;br&gt;jennm@procom.ca&lt;br&gt;Ph: (519) 885-4331 ext. 202&lt;br&gt;Fax: (519) 885-5308&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PROCOM - "Bringing People &amp; Technology Together"</content>

    <content>I found a good article from July 30, 2007 issue of Computer World. If you prepare an interview, it might help reading it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't attach the file. (error with &lt;br&gt;"Warning: move_uploaded_file(data/career/Why_Should_I_Hire_You.doc) [function.move-uploaded-file]: failed to open stream: Permission denied in /home/coskaco/public_html/v2003/write_ok.php on line 221&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: move_uploaded_file() [function.move-uploaded-file]: Unable to move '/tmp/phpKihh2J' to 'data/career/Why_Should_I_Hire_You.doc' in /home/coskaco/public_html/v2003/write_ok.php on line 221".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If someone is interested in this article, please send me an e-mail (sun.park@scotiabank.com), then I'll send it to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or you can go to ComputerWorld.com and search 'Why should i hire you' and you'll be able to see it on-line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks</content>

    <content>Looking for volunteering Java enthusiasts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am administering an open source project, which was released last year but has not been maintained actively since then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The project is about managing XML data, or XML database management (see http://xdbms.sourceforge.net/) and introduces lots of latest technologies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are interested in taking this project up to the next level, leave a note or email me at khboo@hotmail.com</content>

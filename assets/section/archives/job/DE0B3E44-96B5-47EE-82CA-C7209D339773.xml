    <content>&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I am wondering which Paradox you mentionend.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;There are several Software Application named 'Paradox'.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Is it data base, graphic tool, or office tool?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Dongwook Kang&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Do you have an extertise in Paradox ? Then please contact me at&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(416) 492-8788 x246 or email to akim@jslss.com.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Thank you&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Andy Kim&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Mr. Kang,&lt;br&gt;I believe it is a database much like MS Access. However I have to check with my friend. He has an application written in Paradox and needs some modification as there is some change in some city document the application produces. Can you give me your phone number I can contact ?</content>

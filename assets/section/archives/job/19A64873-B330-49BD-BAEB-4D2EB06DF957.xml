This is quite a paradigm &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;shift.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Mission-Critical enterprise application and system development expereince is &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;also valued (ERP, H/A, SAN and that type of thing)&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Anyway, even for those system administors, specific package experience (such as SAP) &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;seems to be valued by employers.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Is there anybody who happened to have SAP or Oracle Financial related project &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;expereice? We might form a stduy group because getting SAP or Oracle app.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;project experience is die-hard to get regardless of places.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Even in Korea(I had 1 year contract in Korea upuntil alst month), SAP or Oracle App.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;project has been sustained, postphoned and canceled for last three years. This lack is &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;causing a lot of trouble in Korea like no Korean ERP consultant. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Anybody with enough of industry specific work process and BPR knowledge can be &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;trained as SAP or Oracle App. consultant.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have very large collection of SAP ERP&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;books on consulting, BPR, pjt, implementation and etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;I even have ISP(IT Strategic Planning )consulting project with HP consulting Korea, &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;AT Kearny Korea and Gap Gemini Earnst and Young Korea.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;If interested, please contact me at cosmos@visto.com&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Thank yu,&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;Jay S.

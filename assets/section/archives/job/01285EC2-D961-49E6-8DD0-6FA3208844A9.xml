    <content>Yes, it's hard to find a job, not only AS/400 but the other area too.&lt;br&gt;Since September 11 attacks, The job market in North America is pretty bad, particularly for the people who want to start their career in Canada or US for the first time.&lt;br&gt;If you want to start your AS/400 RPG from the scratch it is going to be very difficult.&lt;br&gt;I am not sure whether you are still in Korea or not.&lt;br&gt;If you are in Korea, I recommand you to stay there for a while - at least one year - and be ready yourself to get&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a job such as&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;study English, RPG/ILE, JAVA if you can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Luck!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;*. 다들 어렵다고 하시는데 AS400/RPG 취업은 어떤가요?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;*. 요즘 웹/Java 기술없이 RPG만 가지고도 구직이 가능할까요?&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;*. 토론토 지역에 AS400 관련 전문 학원이 있다고 들었는데&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;URL 이나 정보 아시면 부탁합니다.&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;AS400으로 취업하신분들의 많은 답변 부탁드립니다. &lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;</content>
